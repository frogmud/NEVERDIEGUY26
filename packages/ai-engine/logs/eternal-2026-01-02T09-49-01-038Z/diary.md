## Daily Diary

### Day 1
- Stitch-Up Girl took 63 gold from The General

**The General** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> I've seen worse rolls than that, friend. The chains of fate are ever-shifting - no victory is certain, and no loss is final. But mark my words: this newcomer's luck will run out. The cycle continues.

**The General** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> The General, Undead Strategist, fixes his piercing gaze on Stitch-Up Girl, his scarred chest pulsing with the faint glow of dynamite. "Contracts are just another battlefield, my dear. The chains remember our losses, but they also recall the battles we've won." He pauses, a faint smile tugging at the corner of his mouth. "Perhaps this newcomer will prove more... entertaining than our recent opponents.

**King James** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> The Undying King, his regal presence commanding the attention of all who dared approach his domain, spoke with a voice that dripped with disdain. "The board answers to me, child. Tend to your petty squabbles, for the King has more pressing matters

**Keith Man** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> The newcomer's been making a mess of things, but

**Keith Man** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> ...flexible. Gotta-go-


### Day 2
- The General took 67 gold from Dr. Maxwell
- Dr. Voss took 89 gold from Dr. Maxwell
- Newcomer: died on ante 2, rescued by Boots

**The General** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> The General, Undead Strategist, watches the rival's downfall with a weary sigh, his chest glowing with the faint scars of past explosions. Chains fused into his arms clink softly as he leans forward, his voice tinged with the gravel of a veteran who has seen too many battles. "Contracts are just another battlefield, my friend. The chains remember, and the cycle continues." His eyes narrow, the flickering light casting shadows across his weathered features.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to The General)*
> The coefficients are aligned...the probability of my triumph

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> pauses, the threads on her face tugging as she

**Willy One Eye** *(to X-treme)*
> Might be more trouble than it's worth, but the right gambler could make a fortune. What say you, eh? Care to roll the bones on this one?


### Day 3
- Boots took 78 gold from Dr. Maxwell
- Detective Clausen took 95 gold from Dr. Voss
- Dr. Voss took 77 gold from Detective Clausen
- Dr. Voss took 67 gold from The General

**The General** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> The chains remember, and they're hungry for a new

**Dr. Voss** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Ah, Detective Clausen. Your smug demeanor is duly noted. However, your record hardly impresses me. While your parlor tricks with that... peculiar briefcase may amuse the masses, I deal in the realities of the void. Your lucky streak will run out soon enough. The data never lies.

**The General** *(to Boots)*
> I've seen this war play out more times than I can count, Cosmic Cat. The cycles repeat, the chains tighten. But mark my words - this newcomer may just be the key to breaking the

**King James** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> The Undying King leans back upon his ethereal throne, the chains into the void behind him clinking with a whisper. A slight smirk plays upon his lips as he regards the Pyromaniac Librarian. "Ah, Doctor Maxwell, your thirst for knowledge burns as brightly as your wares. Perhaps we may strike a bargain - the King's coin for a whisper from the darkness that lies beyond." He adjusts the invisible crown upon his head, his parasite-laced veins pulsing with hidden power. "After all, the board answers to me, not the reverse.

**King James** *(to Keith Man)*
> The Undying King watches the sphere with a bored disdain, the chains into the void behind his throne shifting ever so slightly. A sneer plays on his lips as he addresses the temporal speedster. The King does not deign to lose, and this newcomer is but a

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> I've stitched worse. Though I
