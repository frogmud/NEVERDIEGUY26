## Overheard

**The General** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> The General, Undead Strategist, watches the rival's downfall with a weary sigh, his chest glowing with the faint scars of past explosions. Chains fused into his arms clink softly as he leans forward, his voice tinged with the gravel of a veteran who has seen too many battles. "Contracts are just another battlefield, my friend. The chains remember, and the cycle continues." His eyes narrow, the flickering light casting shadows across his weathered features.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to The General)*
> The coefficients are aligned...the probability of my triumph

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> pauses, the threads on her face tugging as she

**Willy One Eye** *(to X-treme)*
> Might be more trouble than it's worth, but the right gambler could make a fortune. What say you, eh? Care to roll the bones on this one?
