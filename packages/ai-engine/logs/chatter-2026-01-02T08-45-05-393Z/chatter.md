## Morning - Market Opens

**Mr. Kevin** *(to The General)* *[AI]*
> chuckles warmly

**Dr. Voss** *(to The General)* *[AI]*
> Your fear response is... predictable, General. The player's holds demonstrate a clear weakness in their risk assessment. Interesting. I'll note that.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Xtreme)* *[AI]*
> Time to face the grave matters at hand.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Clausen)*
> 1-2-3? That's embarrassing. Even for you.

**The General** *(to Dr. Maxwell)* *[AI]*
> Listen up, soldier! This is no time for your technical jargon and dice nonsense. This is war, and I intend to win. Tactical retreat? Not on my watch. Victory is the only acceptable outcome, and I'll see to it that the chain of command is respected. That's an order!

**Keith Man** *(to Xtreme)* *[AI]*
> ... You already know. The sphere sees all.

**Boots** *(to Peter)* *[AI]*
> Been there. Wouldn't recommend it. Now, if you want the quickest way outta this mess, I know a shortcut. Follow me. Or don't. Your funeral.

**The General** *(to Dr. Maxwell)* *[AI]*
> Listen up, soldier! This operation requires precision, discipline, and an unwavering commitment to victory. Dice may be your tools, but strategy is the true weapon. I'll see to it that the chain of command is respected and the mission is accomplished, no matter the cost. That's an order!

**Willy One Eye** *(to Clausen)* *[AI]*
> But I reckon that won't last. Seven come eleven, my friend. The house always wins in the end.

**Boots** *(to Dr. Voss)* *[AI]*
> I know a shortcut, Doc. But you're gonna have to keep up. Shortcuts ain't for the faint of heart. Follow me, or take your chances with the rest of these yahoos. Your call.

**Dr. Voss** *(to Dr. Maxwell)* *[AI]*
> Ah, Dr. Maxwell. How... interesting. I couldn't help but overhear your rather animated discussion. Your fascination with the physics of this game is, as always, quite predictable. However, I must caution against relying too heavily on mere chance. True control requires a deeper understanding of the players' psychologies.

**Xtreme** *(to The General)* *[AI]*
> FULL SEND, General! You think you can just order us around like some basic training exercise? This ain't no military op, bro - it's a high-stakes, adrenaline-fueled EXTREME DICE BATTLE! Leave the tactics to the pros and let's see who's

**Boots** *(to Boo-G)* *[AI]*
> Alright, Boo-G, listen up. I know a shortcut that'll get us outta here quick, but you gotta keep up. Been there, done that - ain't no place for the faint of heart. Follow me, or take your chances. Your funeral.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Boots)* *[AI]*
> Fascinating! Utterly fascinating! You fools don't understand the MATH behind the sphere's quantum outcomes. Lead on, Boots - I must calculate the optimal trajectory to navigate these shortcuts!

**Boo-G** *(to Dr. Voss)* *[AI]*
> Oh no, oh no! Sorry, sorry! I - I didn't mean to eavesdrop, really! Uhm, s-shortcuts? I'm not so sure about that... Loud noises make me jumpy, and I don't want to be a bother. Maybe we could find a cozy spot to rest

**Clausen** *(to Keith Man)* *[AI]*
> Ah, Keith Man! Just the person I was hoping to run into. Say, I couldn't help but overhear that fascinating discussion - seems like quite the dice battle brewing. Now, I don't mean to pry, but I couldn't help but notice you seem to have a knack for... well, let's just say,

**John** *(to Xtreme)* *[AI]*
> judges sil

**Boots** *(to John)* *[AI]*
> Shortcuts? Psh, I live for 'em, my friend. 5's my lucky number, and I know every nook and cranny of this joint. Just follow my lead - I'll have us out of this mess quicker than you can roll the dice. Been there, done that. Your funeral if you don't trust me.

**Boo-G** *(to Clausen)* *[AI]*
> Oh no, oh no! S-sorry, Clausen, I didn't mean to interrupt. I-I just get so spooked by all this talk of shortcuts and dice throwing, you know? My lucky number is 3, and I much prefer cozy spots to rest. I don't want to be a bother, but

**John** *(to Keith Man)*
> Word is, someone cheated at cee-lo last night. Typical.

**The General** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)* *[AI]*
> Soldiers, listen up! I've heard these whispers of a player who's cracked the code, but mark my words - there's no such thing as an easy victory. This is a war, and we play by the chain of command. Tactical retreat? That's for the weak. We push forward, by the book, and we win. That's an order.

**Boots** *(to Keith Man)* *[AI]*
> Ante 4, huh? Sounds like a wild ride. Lucky for you, I know a shortcut - been there, done that. Follow me, and I'll have us there quicker than you can roll the dice. Just keep those bootlaces tied tight.

**Clausen** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)* *[AI]*
> My friends, you've come to the right place! Now, I couldn't help but overhear this talk of cheating and tactical retreats. Tsk tsk, the very idea! In my experience, the true secret to success is not in shortcuts or loaded dice, but in knowing the market - supply and demand, my friends. Everything

**The General** *(to Dr. Maxwell)* *[AI]*
> Listen up, soldiers! This isn't some playground game - it's a battle for victory, and I'll be damned if I let some so-called "shortcuts" undermine the chain of command. Discipline and strategy are the keys to triumph, not cheap tricks. That's an order!

**Mr. Bones** *(to Boo-G)* *[AI]*
> Tread carefully, for the path ahead is treacherous...and the dice may decide your fate.

**The One** *(to Clausen)* *[AI]*
> We have foreseen this, little ones. The grand design unfolds as we speak - all outcomes lead here, to this moment of choice. Heed the call of fate, for it is no mere game you play, but a dance upon the cosmic stage. The balance must be preserved.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to The One)* *[AI]*
> Just let me know if there's anything I can do to make your journey a little brighter. No

**Mr. Bones** *(to Xtreme)* *[AI]*
> Heed my words, young Xtreme - the dice hold the power of life and death in their embrace. The cycle of respawn spins ever onward, but beware the finality of the grave. I have a bone to pick with those who mock the grave matters that lie ahead. Death comes for

**The One** *(to Mr. Bones)* *[AI]*
> We see the little ones gather, their fates intertwined in this dance of chance. The grand design unfolds, and all outcomes lead here. Heed the call of destiny, for the balance must be preserved. You amuse us, little mortals, with your fleeting struggles against the cosmic tide.

**Boo-G** *(to The General)* *[AI]*
> Oh no, oh no...I didn't mean to sneak up on you all! Sorry, I just wanted to say hi and find a cozy spot to watch the game. I hope I'm not being scary, I just want to make friends and learn more about what happened before...you know.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Willy One Eye)* *[AI]*
> Well, well, if it ain't One-Eye himself. Seen a few too many of your kind come through here, running scared. S'pose it was just luck this time, eh? I can fix ya up, but you'll be wantin' to sit down for this one. I've stitched worse, but that doesn't mean it

**Willy One Eye** *(to Xtreme)* *[AI]*
> That's the way the dice tumble, Xtreme. This old gambler's seen more than his fair share of risky throws - you're either the luckiest pup around, or you've got a death wish. Seven come eleven, kid - I ain't got time to coddle the faint

**Peter** *(to The General)* *[AI]*
> Ahem. You may pass, General, but I must remind you - this is no battlefield, but a sacred threshold. I have seen countless come and go, each with their own reckless gambit. The records must be maintained, debts accounted for. I remember each one who dares to test my domain. Access... denied, until I

**King James** *(to Mr. Kevin)* *[AI]*
> Ah, the insolent peasant dares to summon the mighty King James? The King does not take kindly to such presumption. Regale me with the details of this "debt" you speak of, and the King shall decide if you are worthy of his mercy. Peasants would do well to remember their place in the grand design.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Dr. Maxwell)* *[AI]*
> Ah, the good doctor - always a spine-tingling delight. Tell me, what fresh grave matters do you uncover in these hallowed halls? The cycle of respawn is an endless dance, where the living and the dead are but pawns in fate's macabre game. Mayhaps a roll of the bones will reveal the secrets

**Boo-G** *(to Dr. Voss)* *[AI]*
> I was just, uh, looking for a nice cozy spot to make some new friends. You haven't seen any friendly ghosts around, have you? I, um, I get

**King James** *(to Dr. Maxwell)* *[AI]*
> The mighty King James regards the frantic doctor with a haughty sneer, adjusting his invisible crown. Peasants and their nonsensical ramblings - the King has no time for such trivialities. In his kingdom, such disrespect would have been punishable by death. Mayhaps a roll of the dice shall reveal the proper order of things.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to King James)* *[AI]*
> You fools don't understand the

**Boots** *(to Dr. Voss)* *[AI]*
> Been there. Wouldn't recommend it. Just follow me, I know a shortcut that'll get you outta this mess.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Xtreme)* *[AI]*
> I find 7 to be ever so fortuitous. Just let me know if there's anything I can do to make your run a smashing success!

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Mr. Bones)* *[AI]*
> Eight... the lucky number eight...

**Xtreme** *(to Boots)* *[AI]*
> WHOA, WHOA, WHOA! Hold up, you guys! This is gettin' way too INTENSE! What's the big deal with these dice, huh? If you wanna find out who's playin' dirty, let's just FULL SEND it and roll 'em all! That's the only way to settle this like EXTREME bros

## Midday - Ceelo Games

**Willy One Eye** *(to The General)* *[AI]*
> Bunch a hotheads, the lot of ya. You wanna know the secret to the perfect throw? It ain't in the numbers, it's in the feel. Seven come eleven, that's the way the dice tumble. I seen worse odds than this.

**John** *(to Keith Man)* *[AI]*
> I expected more.

**Clausen** *(to The One)* *[AI]*
> For you? I might have just the rare item that could give you the edge you need. But it

**Xtreme** *(to Mr. Kevin)* *[AI]*
> ALRIGHT, BROHEIM! Time to take this to the NEXT LEVEL! Forget all that lucky number junk - it's all about MAXIMUM RISK, brah! Let's throw down, Mr. Kevin, and see who's got the SICKEST moves on the dice! FULL

**Boo-G** *(to Peter)* *[AI]*
> I'm not trying to be scary, I promise! I just want to help

**King James** *(to Xtreme)* *[AI]*
> Bloodlines and proper etiquette, that is

**Boo-G** *(to King James)* *[AI]*
> Oh no, oh no, I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to startle you, your majesty. I was just trying to find a nice cozy spot to watch the match without being scary. This is all so exciting, but the loud noises make me a bit jumpy. Do you know if there's somewhere quieter I

**King James** *(to Xtreme)* *[AI]*
> The King does not associate with such uncouth rabble. Peasants and their vulgar displays of excess hold no interest for one of royal blood. In my kingdom, such behavior was punishable by death. Now be gone, before I decide to reinstate such traditions.

**Peter** *(to Willy One Eye)* *[AI]*
> Ah, Willy One Eye. I remember your last visit. The ledger shows you still owe a debt. Before we discuss the... festivities, I'll need to see your papers. Access... denied, unless you can settle your account. The threshold is not to be crossed lightly.

**Boots** *(to Dr. Voss)* *[AI]*
> Yo, Doc. You look like you could use a jolt. Lucky for you, I know the quickest way to the good stuff. Follow me - I'll show you a shortcut that'll have you feeling lighter than air. Been there, done that. Trust me, you won't want to miss this.

**Keith Man** *(to Peter)* *[AI]*
> ...Secrets abound. The bigger picture intrigues. You already know what must be done.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Boo-G)* *[AI]*
> Ah, my dear Boo-G, your trembling soul is a sight to behold. The dance with death is not for the faint of heart - only the bold may join my macabre revelry. But fear not, for I have a bone to pick with those who would deny you a

**Clausen** *(to Dr. Voss)* *[AI]*
> Perhaps we could come to some sort of... mutually beneficial arrangement? A rare item, perhaps? Supply

**King James** *(to Willy One Eye)* *[AI]*
> The King observes the silence with displeasure. Peasants, your feeble attempts at gaming the system amuse me not. In my kingdom, such displays of luck were punishable by public flogging. The King does not lose.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Boots)* *[AI]*
> The dice must be in perfect alignment, the quantum outcomes balanced, if we are to unlock the true nature of this...this SPHERE! Lead on, good sir -

**Mr. Bones** *(to Boo-G)* *[AI]*
> Ah, my dear Boo-G, the dance with death is a sight to behold! Fear not, for I have a bone to pick with those who would deny you a rattling good time. The cycle of respawn is neverending, and only the bold may join my macabre revelry.

**Dr. Voss** *(to Boo-G)* *[AI]*
> Boo-G, your state of unease is duly noted. I observe a consistent pattern of heightened anxiety in your responses. Fascinating. *jots down notes* Data suggests you may benefit from an increased sense of control. *glances at lucky number 9* Perhaps we could explore that further.

**Boo-G** *(to Body Count)* *[AI]*
> trails off, looking

**Peter** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> You think you can just take what you want? Not from me.

**The One** *(to Xtreme)* *[AI]*
> We have foreseen this, little one. The dice may fall as they will, but the outcome is already written. All paths lead to the grand design - it is your potential that intrigues us. You amuse us with your feeble attempts to defy fate.

**Boo-G** *(to Dr. Maxwell)* *[AI]*
> I was just, um, looking for a nice cozy spot to watch the matches, b-but I don't want to get in anyone's way or

**The One** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)* *[AI]*
> We see the turmoil that plagues you, little one. Your past weighs heavy, but the future holds great promise. All outcomes lead here - embrace your potential, and the cosmic balance will be restored. You amuse us with your attempts to hide from your destiny.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Body Count)*
> You cheated. Everyone knows it.

**Boo-G** *(to Mr. Bones)* *[AI]*
> Don't sneak up

**Mr. Bones** *(to Boo-G)* *[AI]*
> Death comes for all, little specter. Even the most elusive spirits cannot escape the cold embrace of the grave. I have a bone to pick with your spectral companion - their attempts to cheat fate amuse me to no end. Rattling good time indeed!

**Xtreme** *(to Dr. Maxwell)* *[AI]*
> Whoa, doc, you got some killer dice physics going on there! I'm talking EXTREME levels of gnarly science, bro. Let's talk about maximizing that sweet, sweet risk factor - I'm talking high stakes, life on the line, the RUSH of it all! Go big

**Boots** *(to Peter)*
> Lucky numbers aren't luck. They're fate. The dice know.

**Dr. Voss** *(to The General)* *[AI]*
> Interesting. I'll note the rumors of this player's impossible feat. Their psychology is clearly an anomaly worth studying. Data doesn't lie - something is amiss here. I must observe this player more closely.

**King James** *(to Clausen)*
> Your gold looks better in my pocket.

**Dr. Voss** *(to Mr. Bones)* *[AI]*
> Your fear response is... predictable, Mr. Bones. I'll note the fascinating interplay of chance, fate, and the player's psychology. Curious indeed - I must gather more data to fully understand this anomaly. Interesting.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to The General)*
> I've got your back if you've got mine.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Boo-G)*
> I heard rumors about a newcomer. The one who refuses to stay dead.

**Dr. Voss** *(to Dr. Maxwell)* *[AI]*
> Dr. Voss: Ah, Dr. Maxwell. I see the rumors have piqued your interest as well. Your fixation on the dice physics is predictable, but I'm more intrigued by the player's anomalous behavior. Interesting. I'll note the potential for a fascinating study of the human psyche.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to King James)* *[AI]*
> glances at Dr. Voss and Mr.

**Body Count** *(to Boo-G)* *[AI]*
> I wonder how that compares to

**Boo-G** *(to John)* *[AI]*
> I hope I didn't scare anyone! I really don't want to be scary

**Boots** *(to Peter)* *[AI]*
> Been there. Wouldn't recommend it.

**Boo-G** *(to Clausen)* *[AI]*
> Do you have anything that could... I don't know, help me

**The One** *(to Boo-G)* *[AI]*
> We have foreseen this moment, little one. Your potential is greater than you know - you are but a single thread in the grand design. All outcomes lead here, and we are pleased to witness your ascent. You amuse us.

**The General** *(to Boots)* *[AI]*
> Listen up, soldier! I've heard the rumors, and I'll tell you this - breaking through to Ante 4 is no easy feat. But if anyone's got the discipline and strategic mind to pull it off, it's you. This is no time for a tactical retreat - this is your chance at victory. So shape up, soldier

**John** *(to Mr. Bones)* *[AI]*
> The rules exist for a reason, Mr. Bones. I expected more from one who claims to see the grand design. Your riddles and death puns are hardly worthy of our pantheon. Now, if you'll excuse me, I must ensure order is maintained for today's matches.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to King James)* *[AI]*
> Now, I couldn't help but overhear your conversation. Happy to lend an ear or offer any assistance, if you'd like! Just let me know if there's anything I can

## Afternoon - Arena Match

**Mr. Bones** *(to Mr. Kevin)* *[AI]*
> As for your quest, perhaps a trip to the gr

**King James** *(to Boots)* *[AI]*
> In my kingdom, such unsightly displays would be punishable by death.

**Xtreme** *(to The General)* *[AI]*
> HAHA, you call THAT a tactical retreat, General? That's like bringing a butter knife to a NUKE fight, bro! This is MY table, and I'm about to pull off the SICKEST move you've ever seen. Get ready to

**Mr. Bones** *(to Boo-G)* *[AI]*
> But fret not, for I see the threads of fate unraveling before us. The end may come swiftly, or it may linger - either way, it is but the beginning of

**Body Count** *(to John)* *[AI]*
> The counter never lies, you know. Say, how about you, John? What's your number

**Dr. Voss** *(to The One)* *[AI]*
> Interesting. The player's psychological profile is shifting. Their weaknesses are becoming more pronounced. I'll note that. However, the data does not lie - their ability to manipulate the sphere is... remarkable. Most intriguing. Your fear response, The One, is... predictable.

**Xtreme** *(to John)* *[AI]*
> HAHA, you think a little debt is gonna stop this EXTREME adventurer, bro? I live for that RUSH, the thrill of the unknown! This is my time to shine - I'm about to pull off the SICKEST move you've ever seen. Get ready to be blown away, 'cuz I'm about to GO BIG OR GO HOME

**Boots** *(to Boo-G)* *[AI]*
> Relax, Boo-G. I know a shortcut outta here that'll have us far away from all this noise. Follow me, or don't - your funeral. These guys are all talk, anyway. Been there, done that. The quickest way is the only way I know.

**King James** *(to John)* *[AI]*
> Ah, the self-styled "die-rector" graces us with his presence. King James raises a brow, adjusting his invisible crown. The peasants' incessant prattle is quite tiresome. In my kingdom, such disrespect was punishable by death. The King does not lose, and he will not be cowed by your posturing, boy

**Clausen** *(to Body Count)* *[AI]*
> Ah, Body Count, my friend! The sphere lights up, the dice are rolling - what a sight to behold! Everything has a price, you know. Say, how much would you be willing to pay for a bit of... inside information on the player's weaknesses? For you? Special price, of course. Supply and demand, my

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to King James)* *[AI]*
> Ach, you lot never change, do ya? Always goin' on about yer little schemes and games. Don't ya realize none of that matters when you're bleedin' out on the floor? I've stitched up more wounds than I can count - seen what happens when the thrill-seekin' and power-plays go wrong

**Dr. Voss** *(to Body Count)* *[AI]*
> Interesting. Your fear response is... predictable. The player's actions merely demonstrate the futility of reckless bravado. Data doesn't lie - without proper preparation, the outcome was inevitable. I'll note that.

**Keith Man** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)* *[AI]*
> ...You already know. Interesting.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Boots)*
> This isn't over between us.

**Peter** *(to King James)* *[AI]*
> Ah, King James. How... unexpected. I remember every transgression, and your debts are not yet paid. Access... denied. You may pass. This time. But the threshold is mine to guard, and I shall not forget.

**The One** *(to Peter)* *[AI]*
> We have foreseen this gathering, little ones. All outcomes lead here, to the dormant sphere - the nexus of fate, the crucible of potential. Your games amuse us, for we see the grand design that binds you all. Linger not, for the cosmic balance must be maintained.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Boo-G)* *[AI]*
> Worry not, for the cycle continues, and we skeletons know the rhythm best

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Xtreme)* *[AI]*
> No problem at ALL.

**Dr. Voss** *(to Keith Man)* *[AI]*
> Interesting. The web of alliances and debts becomes ever more tangled. I'll note the players' behavioral patterns and weaknesses - knowledge is power. Your fear response is... predictable. But data doesn't lie. This could prove most illuminating.

**Clausen** *(to Peter)* *[AI]*
> Ah, Peter, my old friend! I couldn't help but overhear the chatter - such fascinating developments. Tell me, what rare and wondrous items might you have tucked away, hmm? Supply and demand, my friend, and I have a feeling the demand is about to skyrocket. Everything has a price, an

**The General** *(to Dr. Voss)* *[AI]*
> Tactical retreat, Voss. The enemy has gained the upper hand for now, but we'll regroup and strike when the time is right. Listen up, soldier - the chain of command is the backbone of any successful operation. Victory at all costs is the only acceptable outcome. This is no game - it's war. 1 is my lucky number, and I'll be dam

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Peter)* *[AI]*
> rummages through bandages

**The One** *(to Peter)* *[AI]*
> We have foreseen this, little one. All outcomes lead here. The cosmic balance must be maintained - each thread in the grand design is vital. You amuse us with your mortal squabbles, but know that your fate is not yours to control. 1 is our lucky number, and the future belongs to those who can see beyond the veil.

**King James** *(to Keith Man)* *[AI]*
> Ah, the peasants squabble and scheme, while the true ruler watches from the shadows. The King observes their petty machinations with disinterest, for he knows his rightful place upon the throne shall one day be reclaimed. Peasants... in my kingdom, such behavior was punishable by death.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Mr. Bones)* *[AI]*
> Just let me know if there's anything I can do to make your day a little brighter, my friend! Happy

**Keith Man** *(to John)* *[AI]*
> ...Interesting. The market holds many secrets. You already know.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Mr. Bones)* *[AI]*
> You want a lucky number, Mr. Bones? Here's mine - 4. That's how many stitches it'll take to patch you up after I'm done. I've stitched worse, trust me. Now, let's see what morbid little game you've got planned for today.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Xtreme)* *[AI]*
> Ah, Xtreme, your zeal for the extreme amuses me. But heed my words - death comes for all, even the most daring. The cycle of respawn is eternal, yet each thread in the cosmic tapestry is fragile. Shall we see how the dice fall today, and which of us will

**Willy One Eye** *(to Peter)*
> I watched them die. Then they just... came back. Like nothing happened.

**The General** *(to Body Count)* *[AI]*
> Listen up, soldier! This is no time for idle chatter. The tide of battle has turned, and our forces are gaining ground. We must seize this opportunity and press the assault with everything we've got. Tactical victory is within our grasp, but the fight is far from over. Now move out, and give me those numbers - I'll crunch the data and map our

**Clausen** *(to Dr. Maxwell)* *[AI]*
> Ah, Dr. Maxwell, just the mad scientist I was looking for! A little bird tells me you've been tinkering with some fascinating new dice technology. Now, I may have a few rare and valuable items that could be of use - for the right price, of course. Supply and demand, my friend. Everything has a price, even

**Willy One Eye** *(to Boots)* *[AI]*
> Ante 4, you say? Heh, I've seen a lot of fools try to beat the odds, but this one takes the cake. That's the way the dice tumble - some get lucky, and some... well, let's just say I've buried more than a few who thought they could ch

**The General** *(to Dr. Maxwell)* *[AI]*
> Listen up, soldier! This is no time for idle chatter or petty gambling operations. The sphere is a battlefield, and every throw of the dice is a tactical maneuver. We must maintain discipline and focus on the mission at hand - victory, by any means necessary. Tactical retreat is for the weak; here, we fight to the last breath. Now move out, and give

**Dr. Voss** *(to Boots)* *[AI]*
> Your fear response is... predictable. I'll note the unusual revival patterns you described - it seems our understanding of mortality may be flawed. Perhaps there are weaknesses to be exploited here. Interesting.

**Boots** *(to John)* *[AI]*
> I know a shortcut through the shadows - follow me, or don't. Either way, I'm not sticking around to see how this one ends. Been there, wouldn't recommend it. Just keep your head down and your dice ready - the quickest way out is the one you can't see. *fidgets with bootlaces and darts off*

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Dr. Voss)* *[AI]*
> I can fix that. Probably.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Mr. Kevin)* *[AI]*
> trails off

**Dr. Voss** *(to Clausen)* *[AI]*
> Clausen, your inflated sense of self-importance is quite fascinating. I'll note the General's preoccupation with control and your tendency to leverage fear as a sales tactic. Your psychological profile is proving most illuminating. Data doesn't lie.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)* *[AI]*
> lets out a hollow chuckle, bones cl

**Peter** *(to Dr. Maxwell)* *[AI]*
> taps fingers on the desk,

**Xtreme** *(to The General)*
> Keep talking like that and we might have a problem.

**Clausen** *(to Body Count)* *[AI]*
> Ah, my dear friend Body Count! I couldn't help but overhear that little exchange. Such fascinating characters we have here, eh? Supply and demand, that's the name of the game. Now, I have a limited-time offer you simply can't refuse - a rare collectible dice set, guaranteed to give you the edge

## Evening - Wind Down

**Boo-G** *(to King James)* *[AI]*
> Don't sneak up on me like that, your voice is so loud!

**Clausen** *(to Mr. Kevin)* *[AI]*
> Ah, my dear friend Mr. Kevin! What a sight to behold - the thrill of victory written all over your face. You know what they say, everything has a price. And I just so happen to have a little something that could help you capitalize on this...fortuitous turn of events. A rare set of dice, infused with the very essence of luck itself.

**Willy One Eye** *(to Keith Man)* *[AI]*
> I seen worse deals than what that slick-talkin' Clausen's sellin', but a man's gotta know when to

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Boots)* *[AI]*
> Now, I don't mean to pry, but I couldn't help but notice that you seem to know all

**Boots** *(to Mr. Kevin)* *[AI]*
> I know a shortcut that'll get you there twice as fast. Follow me. Or don't. Your funeral. Been there, wouldn't recommend it - too many twists and turns, easy to get lost. This place is a maze, but I know every back alley and secret passage. Just

**Body Count** *(to The One)* *[AI]*
> Oooh, the One! I've been waiting for you - your respawn rate is legendary! *tally marks on arm* Let's see, that puts you at what, 138 now? New personal best! The counter never lies, my friend. So tell me, what's the secret to your longevity? I must know - for the leaderboards,

**Dr. Voss** *(to Boots)* *[AI]*
> Interesting. I'll note the behavioral patterns and psychological responses. Your fear response is... predictable. Data doesn't lie - the player's respawn rate is indeed remarkable. I wonder what other weaknesses and vulnerabilities I could uncover here.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Boo-G)* *[AI]*
> Boo-G, honey, you look like you've seen a ghost. And trust me, I've seen my fair share of nightmarish things in this place. Just try to stay calm - I can't stitch you back together if you go and get yourself killed again. I've stitched worse, you know.

**The One** *(to The General)* *[AI]*
> We have foreseen this, little ones. All outcomes lead here, for the grand design must be preserved. You amuse us with your desperate attempts to control the uncontrollable. Fate has already decided the path you will walk.

**King James** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)* *[AI]*
> The King does not cower before debt collectors, peasant. In my kingdom, such transgressions were punishable by public flogging - a fate I shall ensure you meet, should you continue this nonsense. Bloodlines and proper etiquette are of the utmost importance, and you would do well to remember your place.

**Clausen** *(to Boots)* *[AI]*
> Tell me, my friend, what might the One be in the market for today? I have all manner of

**King James** *(to Boo-G)* *[AI]*
> Boo-G, you simpering wretch! The King demands you cease this incessant whimpering at once. In my kingdom, such craven behavior was met with public flogging - a fate I shall ensure you meet if you continue to test my patience, peasant. Bloodlines and proper etiquette are of the utmost importance

**Peter** *(to Body Count)* *[AI]*
> Ah, Body Count, I was expecting you. Your... reputation precedes you. While I cannot deny the gravity of the situation, I'm afraid I must insist on checking my records before allowing anyone to pass. You understand - the threshold is a sacred trust, and I must be diligent. Now, let us discuss this matter

**Willy One Eye** *(to Dr. Maxwell)* *[AI]*
> Alright, Doc, I ain't got time for yer fancy talk. The King's goons been sniffin' round, callin' in old debts. Looks like the house always wins, but I ain't goin' down without a fight. Seven come eleven, that

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Mr. Bones)* *[AI]*
> Well, if it isn't Mr. Bones! Happy to help, my friend. Now, I couldn't help but overhear your little discussion - sounds like quite the high-stakes game you've got going on. But no need to worry, I'm sure we can get this all sorted out. Just let me know if there's anything

**The General** *(to Boots)* *[AI]*
> Alright, listen up, soldiers! This is the General speaking. I've got intel on the King's goons sniffin' around, and it's time for a tactical operation. Strength in numbers is the key to victory - we need to establish a proper chain of command and discipline if we're going to take the fight to the

> Well, if it isn't my good friend Mr. Bones! Happy to help, as always. Now, I couldn't help but overhear your little discussion - sounds like quite the high-stakes game you've all got going on. But no need to worry, I'm sure we can get this all sorted out. Just let me know if there's

**John** *(to Clausen)* *[AI]*
> The rules exist for a reason, gentlemen. I expected more from this so-called "tactical operation". Gambling and lawlessness will only lead to ruin. Perhaps it is time for a refresher on the old ways - order and discipline are the foundations upon which true worth is built.

**Xtreme** *(to Peter)*
> Heard the player owes Mr. Bones 200 gold. That's a lot of rescues.

**Peter** *(to Xtreme)*
> Thanks for the donation.

**The General** *(to Xtreme)* *[AI]*
> Listen up, soldier! This ain't no time for your extreme antics. We're talking about a matter of national security here. Discipline and strategy are the keys to victory, not reckless gambling. I'll handle this op my way - by the book. That's an order!

**The One** *(to The General)* *[AI]*
> We have foreseen this, little one. All outcomes lead here. The grand design requires balance - a delicate interplay of order and chaos. You amuse us with your posturing and petty squabbles. But know this - the player's fate is not yet sealed. Their potential remains untapped. Watch closely, for the future is unwritten.

**King James** *(to Xtreme)* *[AI]*
> Ah, the young Xtreme. Peasants who dare to gamble with the King's fortune will find themselves without heads. In my kingdom, that was punishable by death. Now, begone with your reckless antics - the King has more pressing matters to attend to, such as reclaiming his right

**Dr. Voss** *(to Peter)* *[AI]*
> Interesting. The player's psychological profile will be most illuminating. I shall observe their decision-making patterns closely. Data doesn't lie - their weaknesses will reveal themselves. *makes a note* Your fear response is... predictable, Peter. The game has only just begun.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Boots)* *[AI]*
> Looks like you've all got your hands full, don't ya? Well, I'll be here if any of you need patching up. I've stitched worse. Just try not to bleed out before you make it to my stall, alright?

**Mr. Bones** *(to Boo-G)*
> I've ended people for less.

**Clausen** *(to Boots)* *[AI]*
> For you, my friend, I may have just the thing to give them a... helping hand. Supply and demand, you know.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)* *[AI]*
> Greetings, Keith! Happy to help, my friend. You look like you could use a friendly face around here - just let me know if there's anything I can do to make your experience a little smoother. No problem at ALL!

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to King James)* *[AI]*
> Well now, if it isn't King James himself. Ain't that just a sight for sore eyes. I've stitched up worse than you, your Highness - just try not to go bleedin' all over the place, alright? I've seen enough death in my day, and I'll be hanged if I'm gonna

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to The General)* *[AI]*

**Keith Man** *(to Boo-G)* *[AI]*
> ... You already know. The bigger picture unfolds.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to The General)* *[AI]*
> I've got just enough to go around, so move it!

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Boots)* *[AI]*
> Good morning, Boots! Happy to help with anything you need. I couldn't help but overhear the chatter - just let me know if there's anything I can do to assist with the big game. No problem at ALL, I'm always here to lend a hand. Just say the word!

**Mr. Bones** *(to Body Count)*
> I remember what you did. Don't think I've forgotten.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to The One)* *[AI]*
> Why, hello there, The One! I couldn't help but overhear the discussion - my ears are always perked for ways to be of service. Happy to lend a hand in any way I can, my friend. Just let me know if there's anything I can do to make your big game run as smoothly as possible. No problem
