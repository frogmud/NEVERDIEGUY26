## Overheard

**Keith Man** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Gotta-go-gotta-go-gotta-outrun

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> Ah, Keith. Always the wild card, aren't you? *A probability chart flashes beside me, the numbers shifting rapidly* The odds may be in your favor today, but don't forget - I hold the true power here. *I cast a disdainful glance at the newcomer* As for that debt... well, the numbers don't lie. This is all... calculated.

**Keith Man** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Just you wait.

**Willy One Eye** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Seven come eleven, Mr. Debugger - your luck has been souring of late, while I've had the odds on my side. This newcomer may think he can best me, but my eye never lies. I'll roll the bones and take what's owed, then we'll see who's really in charge of the probabilities around here.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> That is, if you have the gold to pay the price.

**Boo G** *(to The General)*
> Yo yo YO, The General! That last roll was GHOSTLY, man. How's that old dead body of yours holdin' up? Haha, I'm just playin' - but for real, we gotta get our groove back, ya dig? I'm tilted too, lost big to that Never Die Guy again. But hey, the beats never stop, so let's ride this wave and see where the SPECTRAL FLOW takes us, ya feel me?
