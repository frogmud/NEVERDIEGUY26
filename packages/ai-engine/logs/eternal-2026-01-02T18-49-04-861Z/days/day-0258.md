## Overheard

**Willy One Eye** *(to Boo G)*
> Time to roll the bones and see where the odds take me next.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to The General)*
> I lean back against the market stall, my one good eye narrowed as I watch the General's latest loss unfold. A dark chuckle escapes my stitched lips. Guess that debt of his just keeps growing, doesn't it? Shame, really - I was hoping to put that gold towards some new suture materials. Ah, well. Can't win 'em all, can we, General?
