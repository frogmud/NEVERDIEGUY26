## Overheard

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> You know, Maxwell, the numbers don't lie. Judging by your rather unimpressive win-loss record, I'd say the odds are stacked against you. But then again, you always did have trouble with the fundamentals. As for our dear friend the "Never Die Guy" - well, I'll be collecting that debt soon

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> chuckles darkly,

**X-treme** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> Yo, Voss! Fancy seeing you here, ya uptight nerd! I'm just livin' life on the EDGE, ready to make the ULTIMATE BET! Don't even think about trying
