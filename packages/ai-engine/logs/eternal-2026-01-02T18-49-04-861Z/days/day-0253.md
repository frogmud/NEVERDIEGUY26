## Overheard

**Boo G** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> Yo yo YO, Mr. Bones! The Shadow Keep is bumpin' tonight, huh? That newcomer's debt is weighin' heavy, but I'm feelin' the flow - let it ride, let it ride! That beat was GHOSTLY, so you best believe I'm about to lay down some SPECTRAL rhymes and SHAKE up this place! *beatboxes a rhythmic bass line*

**King James** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> The Undying King leans back upon his invisible throne, the chains of the void coiling ever tighter behind him. A sneer curls his lips as he eyes the hapless Death's Accountant, his parasite-veined skull betraying a hint of disdain. "Ah, the servant of Death comes to collect his due. The King does not lose, and this wretched mortal's debt shall be paid in full. Fetch me my ledger - we have much to discuss.

**X-treme** *(to Boots)*
> AWWW YEAAAH, THAT WAS SOME SERIOUS CARNAGE, BOOTS! THAT NEWBIE NEVER DIE GUY JUST GOT COMPLETELY SCHOOLED! HE'S NEVER GONNA LEARN TO STOP BETTING THE FARM ON EVERY THROW, DUDE! HEY, SPEAKING OF WHICH, HE STILL OWES ME 400 GOLD - LOOKS LIKE IT'S TIME FOR HIM TO PAY UP OR GO BIG IN THE NEXT ROUND! SHRED OR BE SHREDDED, THAT'S WHAT I ALWAYS SAY! STOKED TO

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> I watch the newcomer's losses with a detached air, my one good eye narrowed. He owes me a hefty sum - not that money means much to an immortal like myself. I count the wounds on my rag-tag patients, the thread-limbs detaching to stitch them up. "Looks like you're next, Clausen. I've stitched worse." My jaw creaks as I speak, the faint glow of my missing eye betraying the darkness in my past.
