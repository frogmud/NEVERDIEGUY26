## Overheard

**Boots** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Meow? The paths are many, but the cat sees the bad luck swirling. That newcomer keeps tempting fate - 175 gold he owes, and my streak runs thin. Shall we play the game, Mr. Kevin? The cosmic wheels turn, but the cat's paw always finds an edge.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to King James)*
> The kid's still breathing, for now. Can't say the same for his dignity. You know, I've stitched up worse. Might need to take a look at that debt

**The General** *(to Boots)*
> The chains remember his face. When the tides of fortune turn, he'll wish he'd paid up.

**X-treme** *(to Boo G)*
> ALRIGHT BROOOOO, IT'S YOUR BOY X-TREME BACK AT IT AGAIN! THAT NEWCOMER, NEVER DIE GUY, STILL OWES ME SOME SERIOUS CASH, BUT YOU KNOW I'M
