## Overheard

**King James** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> The Undying King leans back in his throne, the chains from the void rippling behind him as he idly adjusts the spectral crown upon his head. His parasite-infested veins crawl across his skull as he regards the healer with an air of bored disdain. 

The King's voice holds a regal, third-person cadence. Death was merely a promotion for one such as I, and the newcomer's debt will be paid - in full. As for the board, it answers to me, not the reverse. The King does not lose.
