## Overheard

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to The General)*
> This defeat will only stoke the flames higher - mark my words, the next round will be a BLAZING triumph! Now, let us discuss strategies to elevate our wagers - the forbidden tomes await their fiery consumption!

**King James** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> The Undying King fixes the cyclopean merchant with a haughty gaze, his invisible crown glinting in the chaotic winds. The parasite veins crawling his skull betray a hint of disdain as he speaks, his voice dripping with royal authority.

**The General** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> I watch with a mix of pity and resignation as the sorry soul across the way loses yet another wager. The chains on my arms rattle as I sigh, the glowing scars on my chest pulsing faintly. War has made us all weary, Stitch-Up Girl. The contracts never seem to end, no matter how many times the cycle repeats. At least we have each other, even if the newcomer keeps finding new ways to test our patience.

**X-treme** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> YO DETECTIVE, THAT WAS THE SICKEST THROW I'VE EVER SEEN! GOTTA BE RIGGED, NO WAY YOU ROLLED THAT PERFECT 20 LEGIT! THIS AIN'T OVER, BROHEIM - I'M ABOUT TO GO FULL SEND ON THE ULTIMATE BET AND TURN THIS THING AROUND! BETTER WATCH YOUR BACK, CUZ WHEN X-TREME DROPS THE HAMMER, IT'S GONNA BE LEGENDARY!
