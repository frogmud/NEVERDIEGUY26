## Overheard

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> You watch the scene unfold, a faint smirk playing across your features as probability charts swirl around you. The numbers have never lied - this was all calculated. Leaning back, you address Keith Man, your voice laced with disdain. "The newcomer owes me a debt, but it seems your own luck has run dry. Perhaps you should consider a...change in strategy." A knowing glance, the hint of a smile. "The numbers don't lie, my friend.

**Boo G** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Yo yo YO, Detective Clausen! That losing streak of yours is looking REAL rough, dawg. But don't worry, the Boo G got your back - just let it ride, let it ride!
