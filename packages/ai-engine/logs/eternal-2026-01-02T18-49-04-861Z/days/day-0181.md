**Dr. Voss** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> Ah, Stitch-Up Girl. Your volatile past is... fascinating. *notes her injuries with clinical detachment* I've observed your combat data over the centuries - quite erratic, but your resilience is impressive. *pauses, adjusting her void-infused equipment* I suppose the old days had a certain... simplicity to them, before the newcomer arrived and disrupted the balance. *glances at you, eyes reflecting the null space* But data does not lie. The patterns continue to evolve. *tilts her head slightly* Interesting.

**King James** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> The Undying King glares down at the Cyclopean Merchant, his parasite veins pulsing with irritation. His chains into the void rattle as he adjusts the invisible crown upon his head. "Willy One Eye, your meager winnings are but a pittance to one such as I. The newcomer's debt shall be paid, but only when I deem it so. The board answers to me, not the reverse. Now, let us continue our game - the King does not lose.
