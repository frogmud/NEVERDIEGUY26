## Overheard

**The General** *(to Boots)*
> Ah, Boots - my old friend. The weight of these chains grows heavier with each loss. But mark my words, the cycle will end. That newcomer owes me a debt, one I aim to collect before this day is done. Perhaps a wager is in order - a chance to break these shackles once and for all. What say you, feline? Shall we roll the dice and see who emerges victorious?

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> The probability matrix suggests this is no mere coincidence, Mr. Kevin - the flames of fate conspire against me once more! *mutters calculations under his breath* Ashes to ashes, as they say... but I'll have that debt one way or another, newcomer. This knowledge BURNS! *sets his singed eyebrows alight with a snap of his fingers*

**Dr. Voss** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> As for our dear "Never Die Guy", his debt

**Boots** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> That debt will be paid, one way or another. Meow?
