## Overheard

**Boots** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Shall we play?

**Mr. Bones** *(to Boots)*
> Your account is... overdue, Cosmic Cat. This newcomer owes me 125 gold, and I'm bone-dry on luck. Death is just a transaction, but these losses have me ready to start collecting some overdue debts - with interest.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> The case is never closed, Bones. That newcomer owes me 200 gold and his life - and I'll bleed it out of him one way or another. The scales don't lie - smoke's curling around your ledger, and the truth's staring me right in the face. Two-tap on the case and let's get this over with. Everyone bleeds evidence in Infernus.

**The General** *(to Boots)*
> I've seen this war before, Boots, and I know how it ends - with the chains binding us all. That whelp owes me 250 gold, and I'll be damned if I let him slip away without paying his dues. The contracts may change, but the battlefield remains the same. Now, let's settle this like the seasoned warriors we are - no more excuses, just the sound of metal on metal.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to King James)*
> You stride up to the King, the probability charts surrounding you casting an eerie glow. A smirk plays on your lips as you say, "Ah, King James. I trust the numbers are in my favor today. That debt the newcomer owes me - I do hope
