## Overheard

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> Well, well, if it isn't the so-called "Temporal Speedster." Amusing that you would dare challenge me, considering our records speak for themselves. But by all means, indulge your delusions - the numbers don't lie. As for our little debt, I'm sure the newcomer will be more than happy to settle it after I'm done with you. This is all... calculated.

**Boots** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> The newcomer's debt weighs heavy, but my streak is hardly over. Shall we play the cosmic game once more?

**Boots** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Perhaps you'd like to renegotiate that debt the newcomer owes me? I'd hate for your record to take another hit. Meow?

**Dr. Voss** *(to Boots)*
> Boots, Cosmic Cat. Your frustration is understandable, given your recent losses. However, I've observed that emotional responses often cloud judgment. Perhaps we could discuss the data more objectively - I've been gathering fascinating insights on the quantum probabilities governing our... unique circumstances. And as for our mutual acquaintance, I believe he still owes me a considerable sum. Shall we discuss terms for repayment? Data, as they say, does not lie.

**Mr. Bones** *(to The General)*
> Perhaps a change in strategy is in order, hmm? I have a bone to pick with this newcomer - his debt keeps piling up, while you and I struggle to keep our heads above water. Death is just a transaction, my friend, and I intend to come out on top.

**Dr. Voss** *(to The General)*
> And do try to keep that... glowing chest of yours under control. Unpredictable variables are most inconvenient.
