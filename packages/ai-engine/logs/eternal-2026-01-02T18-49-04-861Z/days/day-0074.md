## Overheard

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Boots)*
> This knowledge BURNS, feline - read fast or it's ash!

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Boots)*
> You already know the numbers, Boots. This roll is mere formality - the odds are stacked in our favor. *a smirk crosses my face as the chart flashes with calculations* With a little... "adjustment", we'll walk away unscathed. The throne remains ours.

**Dr. Voss** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Data does not lie, Detective Clausen. That newcomer owes me 100 gold, and his predictable fear responses have only made my research more...fascinating. I've noted your own fluctuating win-loss ratio - perhaps you could learn a thing or two about maintaining composure in the face of adversity. Now, if you'll excuse me, I must return to my experiments. The void calls.

**X-treme** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> HEEEY DETECTIVE CLAUSEN! WHADDUP, DUDE?! Looks like your CRAZY LUCKY STREAK just came to an END, huh? SUCKS TO BE YOU, BROHEIM! Maybe you oughta STEP UP YOUR GAME if you wanna hang with the MASTERS around here. Don't worry, I'll spot you a few BONES to get you back in the action - just don't go BLOWING IT all at once, y'know? GOTTA KNOW WHEN TO HOLD 'EM AND WHEN TO FOLD 'EM!

**Willy One Eye** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> I'll show you a trick or two about probability that'll put that smug look right off your face.
