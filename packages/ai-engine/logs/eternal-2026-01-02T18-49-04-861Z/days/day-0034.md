## Overheard

**Keith Man** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> "lucky" rolls it takes! KevinKevinKevin no wait I'm Keith. Gotta-go-gotta-go-gotta--!

**Dr. Voss** *(to The General)*
> Ah, General. Your continued losses are, as expected, predictable. The newcomer's debt remains unpaid, and his dismal performance is hardly surprising. I've recorded his data - his psychological profile is quite fascinating. Perhaps we should run some experiments to better understand his... resilience. Data doesn't lie, after all. Now, shall we discuss more productive ventures? I have a new theory about manipulating null space that I'd like your input on.

**King James** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> The Undying King leans back upon his ethereal throne, a malicious glint in his eyes as he surveys the detective's misfortune. His chains clatter ominously behind him, a testament to his dominion over the Aberrant. A slight smile plays upon his lips as he speaks, his voice dripping with regal disdain. "Ah, the detective stumbles once more. Perchance the board has grown weary of your petty schemes. Death, it seems, is a promotion unworthy of one such as I. The King does not lose - and today, it is you who shall taste the bitter sting of defeat.
