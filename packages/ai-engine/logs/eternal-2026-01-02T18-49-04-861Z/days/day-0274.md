## Overheard

**King James** *(to The General)*
> The King surveys the dusty market with a regal disdain, his invisible crown glinting in the hazy light. He turns to the General, a wry smile playing on his lips. "The board answers to me, dear General. Worry not - the newcomer's debt will be paid, one way or another. Now, let us see if we cannot turn the tide of this unfortunate losing streak." The chains behind his throne shudder with the shifting of the Void, a silent portent of the power the Undying King wields.

**Willy One Eye** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> My eye's got a knack for seein' the winning plays. That newcomer o' yours owes me a pretty penny - reckon he's due for another visit to my stall.
