## Overheard

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> Stitch-Up Girl, Combat Medic: *Leans back, eyelid drooping over the empty socket* Looks like you're having a rough day, Doc. Maybe you should take a break before you really start tearing yourself apart. I'd hate to have to patch you up again. *Counts the threads in her palm, gaze flickering to the rival's table* Seen worse, but that's still a pretty nasty beat. At least you're still standing. Can't say the same for everyone.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Body Count)*
> The probability matrix suggests our paths are about to cross, Silent Assassin. But I must warn you - the knowledge I wield BURNS! Your tally scars mean nothing to one who has mastered the forbidden arts. This streak of yours ends today. The flames of my fury will reduce your petty victories

**Detective Clausen** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> The case is never closed, doc. But I'm running out of time to cash in on this hot streak before the house comes collecting. Smoke doesn't lie - I'm knee-deep in debts, and that newcomer keeps sticking his nose where it don't belong. Two-tap on the case before I take a shortcut straight to the truth.

**Mr. Bones** *(to X-treme)*
> Perhaps you can lend me a hand... or a rib or two? The Never Die Guy keeps cheating death, and I'm running out of ways to balance the books!

**Dr. Voss** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> Data shows the newcomer's debt to me is overdue. I'll need to collect on that soon - the void hungers for more. As for your record, Mr. Bones, I'd suggest applying more rigor to your methodology. Perhaps we could collaborate on an experiment to improve your... success rate.
