## Overheard

**Boo G** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Yo yo YO, Dr. Maxwell! That last bet was GHOSTLY, know what I'm sayin'? This Never Die Guy keeps comin' back for more, but he owes me 225 gold already! Ain't no way I'm lettin' him slide - time to roll the dice and see if this unlucky streak changes, ya dig? Let it ride, let it ride! That beat was GHOSTLY!

**Keith Man** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> chuckles and darts off, leaving after-

**Boo G** *(to The General)*
> Yo yo YO! Boo G in the house, 'bout to drop some serious knowledge on ya, The General. That streak of losses got ya tilted, huh? Maybe you oughta let the maestro of the spectral flow handle this one - my beats and rhythms got mad probability on lock. But first, that newbie over there better pay up what he owes, or I'm gonna have to start dropping some GHOSTLY beats on his head, ya dig? Now, let's see what kinda moves you got, big guy. *beatboxes a complex rhythm, musical notes
