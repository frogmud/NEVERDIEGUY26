## Overheard

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> Ah, Keith Man. Your smug grin only betrays your desperation. The numbers don't lie - my record speaks for itself. I suppose the newcomer's debt to me will have to wait, as I have a winning streak to reclaim. This is all... calculated.

**Willy One Eye** *(to King James)*
> Seven come eleven, King James. The mists whisper of deals to be had, but my eye sees the odds - and they ain't in your favor today. That newcomer owes me a pretty penny, but maybe we can strike a wager, hmm? My luck's due to turn, I reckon.

**Dr. Voss** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> glances at the foggy mist

**King James** *(to X-treme)*
> The King leans back upon his shadowy throne, chains coiling behind him as he adjusts the invisible crown upon his brow. "The mortal owes his due, and the board will be balanced. As for this... disturbance in the mists, the King shall see it handled with the utmost care. Now, let us discuss the games at hand - the King does not lose.
