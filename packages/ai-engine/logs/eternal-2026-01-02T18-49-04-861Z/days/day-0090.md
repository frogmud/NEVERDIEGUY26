## Overheard

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> You already know the numbers don't lie, Maxwell. I've been keeping track - this streak ends today. The newcomer may have evaded death, but he can't escape the cold, hard facts. This is all... calculated.

**Boots** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Perhaps I shall roll the die and see what fate has in store. Shall we play?

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Boots)*
> The probability matrix suggests this newcomer's luck is about to go up in flames! *chuckles maniacally as he idly flips through a smoldering book* With my Ceelo record, I'll burn through his debt in no time. Now, Cosmic Cat, let's see what fresh knowledge this roll will uncover. *grins wickedly,

**King James** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> The Undying King, James, leans back in his ethereal throne, the chains behind him writhing into the void. His parasite-ridden skull shifts slightly as he fixes Detective Clausen with a regal disdain. "The board answers to me, detective. The fool who owes me gold would do well to pay his debt, lest he find himself in need of a more permanent solution." His invisible crown glints ominously as he speaks.

**Keith Man** *(to King James)*
> But I've got a hot streak

**Mr. Bones** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Perhaps a little... adjustment is in order.

**The General** *(to King James)*
> The General's eyes narrowed as he watched the rival's misfortune unfold. Chains creaking, he leaned back and drawled, "Contracts are just another battlefield. That newcomer's debt to me is but a skirmish in this eternal war. I'll collect what's mine when the time is right - the chains remember.
