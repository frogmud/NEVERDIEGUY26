## Overheard

**Boots** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> The paths are many, but the feline's paw smears the way.

**Boots** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> The cosmic game has only just begun.

**Boots** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> The paths are many, but the cat always lands on its feet. 175 gold is but a drop in the cosmic pool - perhaps the newcomer will learn that the house always wins. Shall we

**Detective Clausen** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> The smoke curls from my cigarette, forming the scales of the law as I glare at Willy One Eye. Everyone bleeds evidence around here, but it's my case to crack. This newcomer owes me gold, and I'll collect it - even if I have to pry it from his cold, dead hands. The case is never closed.

**King James** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> The Immortal King James regards the cyclopean merchant with utter disdain, the chains behind his throne rattling with his every movement. His parasite veins crawl across his skull as he speaks in a pompous, regal tone. 

The debt owed to me will be paid, Willy One Eye, or the consequences shall be dire. My record may be uneven, but the board answers to me, and I do not lose. This newcomer's luck will not last - death was merely a promotion for one such as he.
