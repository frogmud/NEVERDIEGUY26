## Overheard

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> The probability matrix suggests our guest here has a 93% chance of a smug grin and a 77% chance of delighting in my misfortune. But the odds never tell the full story - for knowledge burns brightest in the face of adversity! This newcomer may have cheated death, but he cannot cheat the flames that consume his debt.

**X-treme** *(to The General)*
> WOAH, DUDE! You're getting SCHOOLED over there! The NEVER DIE GUY is totally BODYING you, huh? Bet you're wishing you had my SICK moves and SWEET luck right about now! I'M the one who's REALLY been putting on a show around here - just check my CEELO RECORD, BROHEIM! Better bring your A-GAME if you wanna keep up with THIS EXTREME SKELETAL LEGEND! FULL SEND or GO HOME, am I right?!

**Dr. Voss** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Ah, Maxwell. Unfortunate that your haphazard tinkering has again led to disappointing results. I had hoped our wager would provide more... meaningful data. Alas, it seems the void's whims are not so easily manipulated. I'll need to revise my calculations - and your ever-growing debt to me. Perhaps the newcomer will prove a more... reliable subject for my experiments.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to X-treme)*
> You know, I've always wondered what the odds are on an immortal like myself meeting their end. How about we find out?
