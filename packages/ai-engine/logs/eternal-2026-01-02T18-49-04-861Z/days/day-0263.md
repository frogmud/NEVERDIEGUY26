## Overheard

**The General** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> The General, Undead Strategist, leans back with a weary sigh, chains rattling as his scarred chest glows. I've had more than my fair share of bad beats, Clausen. That newcomer owes me a small fortune, and I'm tired of watching the cycle repeat itself. But mark my words - I'll break these chains one way or another. The contracts are always shifting, but the war never ends.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> As for our newcomer, his debt continues to mount. Perhaps we should have a bone to pick with him, hmm?

**Detective Clausen** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> The case is never closed, doc. Everyone bleeds evidence - and this newcomer's debt is going to stain my books worse than your blackened tomes. Two-tap on the case before I take a shortcut straight to the truth. Smoke doesn't lie - and it's telling me you're just as tilted as I am. Time to even the odds.
