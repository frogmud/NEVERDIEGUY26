## Overheard

**Detective Clausen** *(to The General)*
> The smoke curling from my Noir-stained lips cuts through the haze of my latest bad beat, as I fix The General with a piercing glare. "Everyone bleeds evidence, General - and that includes the new meat, who's done nothing but bleed me dry. The case is never closed, but I'll be damned if I don't find a shortcut to even the score.

**The General** *(to X-treme)*
> The newcomer owes me a debt he'll never be able to repay. Fortune's fickle, but I know war - the only contracts that matter are the ones stained in blood. X-treme, let's see if you've got the grit to play with the big dogs, or if you'll just end up another casualty in my eternal campaign.

**The General** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> I've seen these cycles play out a thousand times, Mr. Kevin. The newcomer may be on a losing streak, but his debt to me is just another contract to be settled. When the dust settles, we'll see who's left standing - the immortal or the mortal fool who thinks he can cheat death. The chains remember, and they demand their due.
