## Overheard

**Dr. Voss** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> Ah, Mr. Bones. Your frustration is understandable, given your losing streak. However, data does not lie - the newcomer owes me a considerable debt, which I intend to collect. Perhaps we could discuss a mutually beneficial arrangement to ensure his repayment. I have some... interesting void experiments that could be of use to you. What say you?

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to King James)*
> The fusion potential of these texts is simply... explosive.
