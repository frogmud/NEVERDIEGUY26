## Overheard

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Boots)*
> friend here. Fate is a fick

**Willy One Eye** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Seven come eleven, Doc! Looks like the odds weren't in my favor again. I'd say I'm down on my luck, but my eye never lies - the colors just ain't right today. Ah well, maybe I'll roll a miracle next time. You got any rare interdimensional widgets that can turn this streak around? My gold's burnin' a hole in my pocket.

**Willy One Eye** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Willy One Eye squints his giant eye, the colors of probability flashing in its depths. Seven come eleven, my eye never lies - but the dice keep turning against me, and that snake-tongued librarian knows it. Maybe the new blood can turn the tide, if he's got the grit. But this market's no place for mortals - I'll have to keep a close watch. One more bad roll and I'll be swimming in debt up to my neck. Time to even the odds.

**Willy One Eye** *(to Boots)*
> Willy One Eye squints his giant, cyclopean eye and lets out a gravelly chuckle. Seven come eleven, friend - the odds are never in my favor these days. But mark my words, the day I roll a perfect combo, I'll be the one laughing. This newcomer thinks he can just waltz in and take what's mine? Not a chance. My eye sees all the angles - I'll outlast this mortal yet.

**The General** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> I've seen this war before, my friend. The ledgers may record our debts, but they cannot capture the weight of history's chains. The newcomer may think he's cheating death, but I know better - the cycle continues, and we are all but pawns in its cruel game. Contracts are just another battlefield, and I've fought on far worse. The scars on my chest may glow, but my resolve burns brighter still.
