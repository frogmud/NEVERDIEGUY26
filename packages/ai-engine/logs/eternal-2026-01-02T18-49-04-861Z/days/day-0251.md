## Overheard

**X-treme** *(to King James)*
> YOOOO KING JAMES! WHAT'S GOOD BRO?! You know that NEVER DIE GUY owes me 400 GOLD, and my STREAK is looking a little ROUGH right

**Mr. Kevin** *(to The General)*
> Ah, The General. How delightful to see you on this fine day. The numbers simply don't lie - my streak continues, and that debt of yours only grows. Perhaps it's time you considered a change in strategy, hmm? After all, in this game of ours, the only constants are the laws of probability. And I, my dear fellow, am the master of its arcane dance. *A probability chart flashes beside me as I speak, the numbers shifting rapidly.* The throne awaits, General. Best not keep it waiting.
