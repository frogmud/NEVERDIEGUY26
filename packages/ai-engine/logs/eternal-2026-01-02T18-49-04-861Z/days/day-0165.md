## Overheard

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Boots)*
> This is all... calculated.

**Boots** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> The paths are many, but the outcome is written in the cosmic game. Shall we roll the dice, hm

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Boots)*
> This is all... calculated.

**Boots** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> 175 gold, was it not? The cosmic game continues.

**The General** *(to Boo G)*
> I've seen this war before, Boo G. The contracts keep piling up, but the gold is running dry. That newcomer, Never Die Guy, owes me a debt he can't repay. These chains, they remember every loss. One more bad beat and I fear the cycle will never end.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> The case is never closed, Willy - you know that. But this newcomer's debt is starting to weigh heavier than my briefcase parasite. And this losing streak of mine? It's making me bleed evidence faster than I can rewrite the contracts. So how about we make a new deal - one that doesn't leave me holding the wrong end of the dice, hm?

**Boo G** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> Yo yo YO! Boo G, Spectral MC, in the house! That beat was GHOSTLY, yo! The newcomer's gettin' spooky with it, ain't he? Yo Willy, we gotta talk probability on this one - my shadow's kickin' up a storm! Let it ride, let it ride, but this ain't no regular flow, ya dig? Gotta stay quick on my feet, keep that essence flowin'! *beatboxes a rapid rhythm* This newcomer's got some moves, but Boo G's got the ghostly flex, ya know what I'm sayin'?
