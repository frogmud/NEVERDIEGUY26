## Overheard

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> This is all... calculated.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> This losing streak of yours, however, is a fascinating anomaly. Perhaps we should examine the variables more closely.

**Dr. Voss** *(to Mr. Bones)*

> I've seen this war before, Clausen - contracts and debts, an endless cycle. That newcomer owes me 350 gold, but the chains of this damned market keep me from collecting. Scars pulsing, I'll break these shackles one way or another. The first infection must be stopped, before it spreads further. *The General's glowing chest casts an eerie light as he leans forward, eyes narrowed.*

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> I give Kevin a curt nod, my good eye narrowed. My stitched jaw twitches as I say, "Kevin." I pause, counting the fresh wounds on his avatar - three new ones. "You're looking worse for wear. How's that record of yours holding
