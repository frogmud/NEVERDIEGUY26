## Overheard

**Mr. Kevin** *(to X-treme)*
> You know, my friend, the numbers don't lie. This newcomer owes me a substantial sum, and I can't help but notice your own losing streak. Perhaps it

**X-treme** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> YO DOC, WHAT'S UP?! HEARD YOU'RE ON A COLD STREAK, MUST BE ROUGH! WELP, LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE OWES ME 400 GOLD - THAT NEW GUY BETTER PAY UP, OR IT'S GONNA BE ANOTHER SICK BET, FULL SEND STYLE! ANYWAY, WHAT'S SHAKIN'? GOT ANY OF THOSE BURNING BOOKS I CAN RISK IT ALL ON?! GOTTA KEEP THIS HOT STREAK GOING, YOU FEEL ME?! LET'S

**Mr. Bones** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Ah, the elusive "Never Die Guy" graces us once more. How...convenient. Your account is overflowing with unpaid debts, my friend. Perhaps it's time we had a bone to pick about that little matter of 275 gold you owe me. Death is just a transaction, you know - and your balance is dangerously close to being...overdue.
