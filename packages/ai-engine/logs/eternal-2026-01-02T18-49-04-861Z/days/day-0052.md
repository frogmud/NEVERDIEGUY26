## Overheard

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> You regard Dr. Maxwell with a disdainful look, your probability charts flickering around you. 'The numbers don't lie, Doctor. Your luck has been... inconsistent. Perhaps today you'll finally break that losing streak - or perhaps not. This is all... calculated.' You offer a thin, humorless smile, already anticipating the outcome of your match.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Body Count)*
> leans in, voice

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> I watch the familiar scene unfold, my lips pressed into a thin line, the threads of my jaw twitching ever so slightly. Willy's frustration is palpable, but I merely cock my head, my lone eye gleaming with a hint of dark amusement. "Tough break, Willy. Guess that's the cost of doing business in this place." I pause, tracing a stray suture on my arm, my voice laced with a clinical detachment. "You know, I've stitched up worse than this. Maybe you should take a seat - you're looking a little green around the gills.

**Boots** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> The paths are many, my friend, but the cat always finds its mark. Your debt grows, and the game continues. Meow?

**Keith Man** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> ...special friend. Gotta-go-gotta-go-gotta--!
