## Overheard

**King James** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> The Undying King observes the strange fog with a raised brow, his parasite veins pulsing beneath his skull. A wry smile curls his lips as he turns to the Pyromaniac Librarian. 'Ah, Doctor, the winds of probability

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to King James)*
> I've seen more than my fair share of carnage over the centuries, King James. These days, I'm just trying to keep the young'uns alive - like our newcomer there, who still owes me a pretty penny. Funny how the more things change, the more they stay the same, ain't it? *lets out a humorless chuckle, eye glowing faintly as the stitches on her jaw tug*

**Boo G** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> Yo yo YO, Stitch-Up Girl! The flow's been off, ya dig? Gotta even out these streaks, let it ride, let it
