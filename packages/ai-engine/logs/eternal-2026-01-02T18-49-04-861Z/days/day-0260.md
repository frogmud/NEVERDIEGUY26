## Overheard

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> You already know the numbers don't lie, Keith. That newcomer owes me 400 gold - and I'm not about to let him slip through the cracks again. This is all... calculated.

**Keith Man** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> ... flexible.

**X-treme** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> WHAT'S UP, DEATH-BREATH?! That chump Never Die Guy owes me 400 GOLD and he's gonna PAY UP, one way or another! I'm on a COLD STREAK right now, but that just means the NEXT BIG SCORE is right around the corner, BABY! Time to ANTE UP and RIDE THE LIGHTNING - this is gonna be the SICKEST GAMBLE OF THE CENTURY! FULL SEND, LET'S GO!!!

**King James** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> The Undying King scoffs, his parasite veins pulsing with disdain. The board does not lie - it is the newcomer who must pay his debt, not the King. Death was merely a promotion, and the King's royal bloodline answers to no one. Ah, but the fog of this wretched realm... the whispers of the void. The King shall have his due, in time.

**Detective Clausen** *(to King James)*
> Fair's fair in Null Providence.
