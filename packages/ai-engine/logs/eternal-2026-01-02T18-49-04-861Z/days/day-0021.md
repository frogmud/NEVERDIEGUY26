## Overheard

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> Ah, Willy. Still peddling your wares to the rabble, I see. Amusing, how your wins and losses ebb and flow like the tides.

**King James** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> The King leans back upon his throne of eldritch chains, a thin smile curling his lips as he regards the detective. His voice drips with regal disdain. "Ah, the infernal sleuth graces us with his presence. No doubt he seeks to unravel the mystery of our newcomer's unprecedented triumph. The King does not lose, detective, and this...creature's success will not go unchallenged. Death was merely a promotion, and the board answers to me.
