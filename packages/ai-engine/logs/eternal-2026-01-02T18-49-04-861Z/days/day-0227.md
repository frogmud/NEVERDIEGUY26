## Overheard

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Keith Man)*
> Now, how about a round where I can incinerate that losing streak?

**King James** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> The King stares down at the detective, his parasite veins crawling across his skull as he adjusts the invisible crown upon his head. The board answers to him, not the reverse, and this newcomer's debt will be paid - with interest. Death was merely a promotion, and the King's immortal reign continues, unbroken by mere chance or chance-mongers.

**Keith Man** *(to King James)*
> ...flexible, King James. That newcomer owes me a pretty penny - 475 gold, to be precise. Gotta-go-gotta-go-gotta
