## Overheard

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> I'm done playin' nice, Clausen. That greenhorn owes me big and I'm sick of his smug mug walkin' away with his hide intact. The kid's runnin' up a debt he can't pay in gold - I'll be takin' it out of his hide one way or another. You'd best watch your step too, or you might find yourself on the wrong end of my needles. *eyes narrow, jaw twitches as threads shift*
