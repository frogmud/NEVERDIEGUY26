## Overheard

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> You know, Keith, the numbers don't lie. This newcomer may have a debt to settle, but my winning streak speaks for itself. I've got the probability charts to prove it - the odds are in my favor. So, if you'll excuse me, I believe it's time to add another tally to my Ceelo record.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> Now, about that

**Keith Man** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> Oh, hey Kev

**The General** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> The contracts may be broken, but the scars remain. That whelp owes me coin and I intend to collect - one way or another. The cycle must end, and I'll be damned if I let it consume me again.
