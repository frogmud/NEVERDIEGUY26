## Overheard

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> The newcomer owes me, but maybe I'll let you pay his debt in ash when I'm through with you!

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> The probability matrix suggests our friend here owes me a sizable debt, yet his smug expression suggests he believes he holds the upper hand. Very well, let me indulge in a little pyroclastic persuasion - this knowledge BURNS! *Sets his sleeve aflame with a flick of the wrist* Read fast, or it's ash!

**Boo G** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Yo yo YO, Kev! You feelin' that weird fog, dawg? Probability's all outta whack - I can barely throw a decent beat! *grins, eyes

**Mr. Bones** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Well, well, if it isn't the Infernal Detective, down on his luck as usual. I'd offer to tally up your debts, but it seems the scales are already tipping in my favor. Perhaps you'd like to make a deal - a little transaction to settle the score? After all, death is just a numbers game, and I have all the winning moves.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Everyone bleeds evidence.

**Keith Man** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> ...flexible.
