## Overheard

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Trust me, Clausen - you do not want to end up on my table.

**Willy One Eye** *(to King James)*
> My eye sees the odds, friend, and they ain't smilin' on me today. Lost another roll, another trade gone bust - bad luck's been houndin' me worse than a pack of hellhounds. Maybe I oughta ask the Undyin' King here for a little...divine intervention. Seven come eleven, my eye never lies, but it sure as the nine hells ain't seein' straight today.

**Dr. Voss** *(to Keith Man)*
> Interesting. Your jittery movements suggest an unstable temporal field. I'll note that - perhaps it will provide insight into your previous losses. As for the newcomer's debt, the data doesn't lie. He
