## Overheard

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> You owe me, you know. Best not forget that.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Keith Man)*
> This knowledge BURNS to know, dear speedster - perhaps you'd care to place a wager? The odds are ever in my favor!

**King James** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> The Undying King's eyes narrowed, the veins in his skull pulsing with an unearthly glow. He leaned back in his throne, chains of void energy coiling behind him, and spoke in a voice dripping with regal disdain. 'The King's luck answers to no mortal dice, Cyclopean. That whelp owes me tribute, and I shall have it - or see his essence torn asunder. The board answers to me, not the reverse.

**X-treme** *(to King James)*
> WHAT'S UP, YOUR MAJESTY?! NICE TO SEE ANOTHER IMMORTAL AROUND THESE PARTS! WORD ON THE STREET IS YOU'RE LOOKING TO PLAY A HIGH-STAKES
