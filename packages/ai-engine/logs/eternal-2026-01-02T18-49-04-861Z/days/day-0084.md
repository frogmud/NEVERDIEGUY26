## Overheard

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Body Count)*
> That newcomer's debt will soon be ashes - a mere speck in the grand conflagration of

**Keith Man** *(to Body Count)*
> no wait, I'm Keith, gotta-go-

**Willy One Eye** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Ugh, look who's slithered in, the Infernal Detective. Thought you were done losing to me, Clausen? My eye sees the odds, and they ain't in your favor today.

Now scurry off before I decide to roll the hard six.

**The General** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> The General, Undead Strategist, glares at the Void Scientist through his glowing chest scars, the chains fused into his arms clinking ominously. I've seen this war before, Voss. Contracts are just another battlefield, and this newcomer owes me a debt that will be paid, one way or another. The chains remember - and they will not be broken so easily.

**Keith Man** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> flexible, but my patience ain't! KevinKevinKevin no wait I'm Keith, the Temporal Speedster - and I'm about to leave your tail in the dust if you don't cough it up, see?
