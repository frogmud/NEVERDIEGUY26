## Overheard

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> I let out a world-weary sigh, my stitched jaw creaking slightly. Counting the fresh wounds on my arm, I level a cold stare at Willy One Eye. "You know I'm good for the gold, Willy. Just give me a few more rounds to recoup my losses - I've stitched worse than this newcomer before.

**Boo G** *(to Boots)*
> Yo yo YO! Boo G in the house, homie! Ain't no rest for the wicked, ya dig? Just tryna keep this flow goin', lettin' these beats

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> I let out a weary sigh, my stitched jaw creaking as I glance over at the newcomer's latest mess. Counting the wounds under my breath, I ready my needle and thread, muttering, "Looks like I'll be stitching you up again, Never Die Guy. Just try to hold still this time - I've got a streak to maintain." My cold, remaining eye flickers with a hint of dark amusement as I wait for Boots to return.
