## Overheard

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to X-treme)*
> The probability matrix suggests this fog holds secrets, X-treme - secrets that BURN to know! The newcomer owes me a debt, but luck has not been on my side of late. Perhaps the random chance of the dice will reveal fortunes anew? *mutters calculations as books smolder in his hands* This knowledge BURNS! Read fast or it's ash!

> ALRIGHT NEVER DIE GUY, TIME TO SETTLE YOUR TAB! YOU
