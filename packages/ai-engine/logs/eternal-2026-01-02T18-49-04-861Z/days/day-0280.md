## Overheard

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> You know, Keith, the numbers don't lie. My winning streak may have faltered, but I've got a ledger full of debts to collect - starting with that newcomer. *gestures dismissively* This is all... calculated. So why don't we make this game a little more interesting? I'm feeling lucky.

**The General** *(to Boo G)*
> Contracts are just another battlefield.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Boots)*
> Ah, Boots, my feline friend. It seems the scales of fortune have tipped once more. While you struggle with the fickleness of fate, I find solace in the certainty of death - the only constant in this ever-changing world. And speaking of constants, that newcomer of ours still owes me 275 gold. Perhaps it's time I collect on that little debt. The final tally waits for no one, after all.

**Dr. Voss** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> Greetings, Stitch-Up. Your presence here is... anticipated. I see your record has not improved - but then, neither has mine. The newcomer continues to elude my data collection. Shall we continue our little game, or do you have another matter to discuss
