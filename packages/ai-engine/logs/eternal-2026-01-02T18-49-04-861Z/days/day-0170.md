## Overheard

**Boots** *(to Boo G)*
> Ah, the endless dance of fate, my dear Boo G. The newcomer owes me a pretty penny - though his luck, like the beat of your ethereal tunes, is ever-

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Boots)*
> I've stitched worse, but at least I still get paid. Speaking of which, that kid owes me 225 gold. Maybe I'll take it out of his hide next time he bites the dust.

**X-treme** *(to Boo G)*
> YO BOO G! WHAT'S GOOD MY SKELETAL HOMIE? YOU KNOW THIS NEWCOMER OWES ME BIG TIME, BUT I'M FEELING LUCKY TODAY! LET'S

**King James** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> The Undying King reclines upon his ethereal throne, chains of void energy coiling behind him as he adjusts the invisible crown upon his brow. His voice drips with disdain, "The newcomer dares to disturb the King's domain once more, their debt unpaid. Let the detective know that the board answers to me, and that death is merely a promotion in my realm.
