## Overheard

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> Let's see if you can keep up.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Boo G)*
> Might have to use a few extra needles

**King James** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> The King, his noble countenance marred by a scowl, fixes the detective with a piercing gaze. His voice dripping with regal disdain, he declares, "The crown answers to no one, least of all this wretched cur who dares flaunt his meager fortunes before the King. The debt will be paid, or the consequences will be most dire." With a dismissive wave of his hand, the shadows behind his throne seem to lengthen, as if heeding their master's unspoken command.
