**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a debt to collect from our dear newcomer. The flames of his existence must be stoked, after all!

**Boo G** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> Yo yo YO, Willy One Eye! The Boo G is feelin' that spectral flow, ya dig? This newcomer ain't got nothin' on my sick beats and lucky rolls. Let it ride, let it ride!
