## Overheard

**X-treme** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> MAYBE YOU COULD HOOK A SKELETON UP WITH SOME VOID TECH, HUH? I'M FEELING LUCKY TODAY - FULL SEND ON THE NEXT GAME OF CEE-LO!

**Boots** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> The newcomer's debt grows, but the cosmic game is afoot.

**King James** *(to X-treme)*
> The Undying King reclines upon his shadowy throne, chains of void energy twisting behind him as he adjusts the invisible crown upon his brow. With a regal disdain, he addresses the skeletal gambler, his parasite-laced veins pulsing
