## Overheard

**Detective Clausen** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> The case may never be closed, Mr. Bones, but this detective's luck is running drier than a bone. The newcomer owes me more than his life's worth, and the scales of justice seem stacked against me. Smoke doesn't lie, and the truth is I'm one bad roll away from being permanently off the board.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Keith Man)*
> Smoke don't lie.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> The case is never closed, Voss. That newcomer's got a lot of red ink to blot out. Smoke doesn't lie - he's trailing a stench of debt and bad luck. Time to cash in on his tab before he kicks the bucket for good.
