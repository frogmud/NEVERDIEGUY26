## Overheard

**Boots** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> The paths are many, but the cat sees the winning streak in your future...or perhaps not. The newcomer's debt lingers, the dice roll ever on. Meow?

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Boots)*
> This is all... calculated.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Boots)*
> You know, Boots, the numbers don't lie. This newcomer may be a thorn in our side, but I've got my eyes on the bigger picture. The probabilities are clear - I'll be the one sitting on that throne, no matter how many bad beats I have to endure. *chuckles disdainfully* This is all... calculated.

**The General** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Contracts are just another battlefield, my friend. The newcomer owes me, but I'll let him collect his winnings first. The chains remember, and they'll be calling in their due soon enough.

**The General** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> I've seen enough bloodshed to last a dozen lifetimes, Voss. That punk owes me a king's ransom, and I'll be damned if I let him skip out on the tab. These chains may bind, but I'll break 'em all to settle this debt - mark my words. The cycle must end, one way or another.
