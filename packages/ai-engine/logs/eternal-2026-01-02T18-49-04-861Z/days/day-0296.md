## Overheard

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> Well, well, if it isn't the Temporal Speedster himself. Enjoying that hot streak, are we? *chuckles* The numbers don't lie - you're just a blip on the probability chart. As for our dear newcomer, I do believe he owes me a rather hefty sum. But don't worry, I've got it all... calculated. This is all part of the game, my friend. *glances at floating probability charts* Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got a throne to claim.

**Keith Man** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> And don't think I've forgotten about that

**Keith Man** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Let's roll and see who's the real Never Die

**Keith Man** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Maybe it's time I cash in on that debt, hmm?

**Mr. Bones** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> Ah, the Reaper's right-hand woman, come to gloat over my misfortune, I suppose? Your ledger may be fuller than mine, but at least I don't have to sew my own jaw back on every time I open my mouth. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a 'never-say-die' mortal to collect from - his account is... overdue.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Boo G)*
> Now, let us discuss the next...combustible investment opportunity.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Smoke doesn't lie - time to get the truth.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Ah, Dr. Maxwell. Always a pleasure to see another immortal struggling with the whims of fate. *A probability chart flickers beside me* The numbers don't lie - the newcomer's debt to me continues to grow. But no matter, I've always been quite adept at manipulating the odds in my favor. *A wry smile crosses my face* This is all... calculated.
