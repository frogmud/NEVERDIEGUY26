## Overheard

**Boots** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> I'll double or nothing that 100 gold. The trickster's odds are always in flux.

> That beat was GHOSTLY!

**Boo G** *(to Boots)*
> Yo yo YO, Boo G in the hizouse! That sphere's got some serious GHOSTLY beats, ya dig? Bet I can toss the dice and make some SICK probability waves that'll have you bouncin' outta your fur, Cosmic Cat! Let it ride, let it ride - time to lay down some IMMORTAL flows!

> You already know the numbers - I've lost my edge. The newcomer's got more lives than a feral cat, and he's still in my debt. But mark my words, Mr. Bones, the tides will turn. This is all... calculated.

**The General** *(to King James)*
> I've seen this game before, Your Majesty. This newcomer has a debt to settle, and their survival is key to ending the cycle. The chains remember - I'll hold up my end of the contract.
