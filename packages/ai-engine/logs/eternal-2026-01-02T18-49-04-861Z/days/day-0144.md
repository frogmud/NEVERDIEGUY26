## Overheard

**Detective Clausen** *(to The General)*
> The case is never closed, General. Guess the dead don't always stay buried - though I suppose that's a problem you're all too familiar with. *coughs, a wisp of smoke curling into the shape of accusatory scales* Smoke doesn't lie, and it's telling me you're due for another bad beat. Maybe this newcomer will be the one to put you out of your misery - or maybe he'll just end up owing me more than he can pay. *taps the battered briefcase at his side twice* Either way, the truth always comes out.
