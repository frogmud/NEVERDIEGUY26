**Boots** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Now, if you'll excuse me

**Boots** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> The newcomer owes me, but I'll be collecting from you.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> I've seen more blood than most, Clausen, but this is getting old. The new guy owes me enough to buy a damn kingdom, and I'm down to my last thread. Stitched worse, sure, but I'm running out of places to keep my eye. Maybe we oughta take a break - get a drink or something, take the edge off before I start counting your wounds too.
