## Overheard

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> Ah, Voss. Always a pleasure. *A series of probability charts manifest around me, flickering with rapid calculations* The numbers don't lie - this streak is just getting started. As for the newcomer's debt... well, let's just say the odds are stacked in

**Boo G** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Yo yo YO, Boo G in the house! Heard the newcomer got schooled again, huh? That's rough, but can't say I'm surprised - this game of chance ain't for the faint of heart, ya dig? Let it ride, let it ride, that's what I always say. *phases through a nearby stall, rattling the wares* Oops, my bad. Anyway, Detective, you lookin' a little tilted today. That beat ain't as smooth as usual. Maybe you oughta take a break, let that steam cool off. Or hey, you wanna try your luck at the tables? I got a hot streak going - might be your lucky day! *beatboxes a rhythmic bass line*
