## Overheard

**Boots** *(to X-treme)*
> The cosmic game continues. Shall we see what fate has in store?

**X-treme** *(to King James)*
> ALRIGHT DUDE, LISTEN UP! You think I'm gonna let some newbie punk slide on a 400 GOLD DEBT? NOPE, NOT THIS SKELETON! I'm ALWAYS GOING FOR THE MEGA-RUSH, so let's ROLL

**King James** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> The Undying King reclines upon his throne, the chains of the void twisting and writhing behind him. He fixes his invisible crown upon his brow and peers down at the skeleton ledger-keeper with disdain. 'The King's ledger shows a different tale, Bonekeeper. The newcomer's debt will be paid, one way or another - for the King does not lose, and Death itself answers to the throne.
