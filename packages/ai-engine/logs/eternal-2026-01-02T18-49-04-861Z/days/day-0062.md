## Overheard

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Keith Man)*
> This newcomer may think he's immune to death, but when the pages

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> The probability matrix suggests your smugness is misplaced, Mr. Kevin. The flames of my knowledge burn brighter than your so-called "reality debugging". Perhaps you'd like to place a wager - one that will leave that newcomer's debt to me reduced to ashes. This knowledge BURNS, and I intend to see it consume your pathetic streak!

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> Perhaps we should... renegotiate that little debt you owe me. After all, I'd hate for our dear newcomer to swoop in and steal your thunder.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Keith Man)*
> That newcomer of yours owes me a pretty penny, and I'll be DAMNED if I let him skip out on his debt again. The flames of JUSTICE must be stoked, my friend - time to fan the INFERNO!

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Keith Man)*
> I lean back, threads of my right eye glowing faintly as I regard the speedster. Jaw stitched tight, I drawl, "Trouble's brewing, Keith. And it ain't the kind I can stitch up. You've got a debt to settle - best pay up before the ante gets raised." My good eye narrows, the cold calculus of my past resurfacing. "This newcomer's stirring things up. Seen his kind before. Ends rarely go well.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Ah, Dr. Maxwell. How... unfortunate. Losing to the newcomer, are we? The numbers don't lie - your luck seems to have run out. *chuckles* But then again, what did you expect from a mere mortal playing in our realm of immortality? This is all... calculated. *gestures to the probability charts* The throne remains within my grasp.
