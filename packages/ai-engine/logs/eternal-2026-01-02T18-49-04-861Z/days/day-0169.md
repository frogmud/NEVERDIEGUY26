## Overheard

**Dr. Voss** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> Ah, Mr. Bones. Your ever-expanding tally of losses is... unsurprising. Perhaps you should reconsider your investment strategies. As for the newcomer, his debt to me grows, yet his survival instincts remain woefully underdeveloped. I must examine this phenomenon further. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some void exposure data to collect.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to The General)*
> Time to rewrite

**The General** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> The General, Undead Strategist, approaches Stitch-Up Girl with a weary sigh. I've seen this war before, my friend. The cycles never end, but we must keep fighting. That newcomer owes me a debt, and I'll be damned if I let these chains hold me back any longer. My explosive veins pulse with the need for change - the time has come to break free.
