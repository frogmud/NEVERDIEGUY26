## Overheard

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> The numbers don't lie, my friend. This game is mine to win - as it has been, and ever shall be.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Keith Man)*
> Read fast or it's ash - for in this game of Cee-lo, I hold the lucky die! The newcomer may owe me, but his debt pales in comparison to the riches of forbidden wisdom I shall claim from you.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> You know, Keith, the numbers don't lie. My win-loss record speaks for itself. This little streak of yours won't last - it's all calculated. *glances at charts* I'd be careful if I were you. Wouldn't want to end up like our dear friend, the Never Die Guy, now would we?

**Detective Clausen** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> The smoke from my Chesterfields curls into scales around my weathered face as I level a bloodshot glare at the Stitch-Up Girl. The case is never closed - this newcomer's debt is a thorn in my side, and I'll bleed the truth from him if I have to. Everyone bleeds evidence, and it looks like I'm next on the chopping block if I don't even the score. Two-tap on the briefcase before I make my move - the scales don't lie.
