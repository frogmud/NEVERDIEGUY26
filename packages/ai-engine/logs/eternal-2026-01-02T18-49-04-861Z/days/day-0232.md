## Overheard

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> And as for our dear newcomer's debt - well, I'm sure we can come to some... mutually beneficial arrangement. After all, I've been playing this game for far longer than either of you. The throne is mine for the taking.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> After all, you already know how this story

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> You already know the numbers don't lie, Keith. I'm on a hot streak, and that newcomer owes me 200 gold. This is all... calculated. Probability is on my side, and I intend to keep it that way.

**Willy One Eye** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Seven come eleven, doc! This newcomer's got me down more gold than I've seen in centuries. Probability's a fickle mistress - one minute she's smiling, the next she's laughing in my face. But mark my words, my eye never lies. I'll turn this streak around, even if I have to dice-roll my way to the top. You got any books that can tell me how to beat this Never Die Guy at his own game?

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Boo G)*
> This immortal's patience wears thin, Boo G. We must divine the path forward, lest the inferno consume us all!

**The General** *(to X-treme)*
> I've seen this war before, X-treme. The newcomer's debt to me is just another contract - one I intend to collect, even if it means breaking a few more chains. These losses have only hardened my resolve. The battlefield waits for no one.
