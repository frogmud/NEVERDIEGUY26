## Overheard

**King James** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> The Undying King of Never Die Guy Market observed the Void Scientist with an imperious gaze, the chains of the void itself coiling behind his throne. His parasite-laced veins pulsed as he spoke, his voice dripping with royal disdain.

**Boo G** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> Yo yo YO! Boo G in the house, baby! That beat just dropped me harder than a sack of bricks. This Never Die Guy owes me mad gold and he keeps comin' back for more! I'm tilted off the edge, Willy - that probability fog's got me all outta whack. Gotta find my rhythm, ya dig? Let it ride, let it ride! This ghostly flow ain't gonna fix itself. That beat was GHOSTLY, but I'm just tryna stay in the game, feel me?
