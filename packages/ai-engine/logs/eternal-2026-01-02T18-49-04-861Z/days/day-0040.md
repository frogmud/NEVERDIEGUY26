## Overheard

**Willy One Eye** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Perhaps you'd care to try your luck again? I've got a few rare trinkets that may just turn your fortunes around.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> You already know the numbers don't lie, Willy. My record speaks for itself - this streak will be short-lived. Perhaps you should consider the...probabilities before stepping into my arena. *chuckles* After all, I've existed in this market for centuries. This game is child's play to me.

**Willy One Eye** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Seven come eleven, my friend. Today, the house wins.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> You know, Willy, the numbers don't lie. My win-loss record may be a touch less flattering than yours, but I've got a few tricks up my sleeve. This newcomer thinks he can waltz in and disrupt the natural order, but I've been perfecting my craft for centuries. The throne is mine to lose - and I don't intend to lose. *

**X-treme** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> AHHHH, WHAT'S UP DETECTIVE?! THIS SNOWSTORM IS CRAMPING MY STYLE, BRO! I'M ABOUT TO GO FULL SEND ON THE NEXT CRAZY BET I CAN FIND - GOTTA GET THAT STEAK BACK AFTER I JUST LOST EVERYTHING ON A WILD DICE ROLL! THAT NEVER DIE GUY IS STARTING TO REALLY GRIND MY GEARS, ALWAYS CHEATING DEATH AND MESSING UP MY STREAKS. BUT HEY, THAT'S THE NAME OF THE GAME IN THIS WILD MARKET, AM I RIGHT

**X-treme** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> Still tryin' to figure out how to bend the laws of reality, huh? WELL WHEN YA GONNA LEARN - THERE A
