## Overheard

**Keith Man** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> grins behind gas mask, jittering with anticipation

**Willy One Eye** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> My dice-grin widens as I gesture towards the table, ready to make a deal that will tip the scales in my favor once

**Willy One Eye** *(to King James)*
> Heh, the luck of the dice is a fickle mistress, King James. I've seen fortunes rise and fall on a single roll. But my eye never lies - the odds are in your favor

**King James** *(to The General)*
> The King's face twists in irritation, the parasitic veins crawling across his skull pulsing with his agitation. He gestures grandly, the chains snaking behind his throne stirring ominously. The King speaks in a thunderous tone, "The King does not lose, General. This newcomer's luck is but a fleeting fancy - soon it will be the King's turn to reign supreme once more. Let us take counsel and devise a strategy to bring this usurper to heel.
