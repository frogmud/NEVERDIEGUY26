## Overheard

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Boots)*
> You already know the numbers don't lie, Boots. Our newcomer friend may have a knack for avoiding the reaper, but against the cold hard facts of probability, his luck will only stretch so far. *glances sidelong at Cosmic Cat* As for you, my feline friend, I'd be careful about getting too comfortable up there. One slip, one miscalculation, and that

**Boots** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> This newcomer owes me, but the cosmic game is far from over. Shall we see what the dice have in

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Just don't blame me when your streak goes up in flames!

**Mr. Bones** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> And as for our dear newcomer, well, his debt to me only grows. I'll be sure to collect... eventually.
