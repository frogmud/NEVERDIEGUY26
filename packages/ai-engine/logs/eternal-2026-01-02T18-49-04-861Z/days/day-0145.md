## Overheard

**King James** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> The Undying King leans back upon his spectral throne, his parasite-laced veins pulsing with amusement as he watches the hapless librarian's misfortune unfold. Adjusting the invisible crown upon his brow, he murmurs in a voice dripping with disdain, "The board answers to me, not the fickle whims of fortune. The mortal owes me a debt, and I shall collect it in due time - for death was merely a promotion for one such as I.

**King James** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> The Undying King shifts his invisible crown with a disdainful gesture, his parasite-ridden veins pulsing with ancient knowledge. Locking his piercing gaze upon the Void Scientist, he utters in a regal tone, "Ah, Doctor Voss. The board answers to me, not the reverse. Pray you do not forget your place, lest you find yourself in the void's embrace once more." A knowing smile curls his lips as he contemplates the newcomer's debt, the chains behind his throne rattling with the weight of his immortal power.
