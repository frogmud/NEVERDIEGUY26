## Overheard

**King James** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> The King's brow furrows, his parasite veins crawling across his skull as he glares down at the wretched merchant. Chains from the void whip and coil behind his throne, a silent warning. Adjusting his invisible crown, he declares in a booming, regal tone, "Willy One Eye, you dare to tilt before the immortal King? The board answers to me, not the other way around. That whelp owes me 300 gold - see that it is collected, or face the consequences of defying the crown.

**King James** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> The Undying King leans back upon his ethereal throne, chains cascading into the void behind him, and regards the Pyromaniac Librarian with haughty disdain. A sneer curls his lips as he speaks, his voice dripping with royal condescension. The parasite veins in his skull pulsate as he declares, The board answers to me, doctor, not the other way around. And that wretched newcomer shall pay his debt, lest he wish to face the King's wrath. Now, what trifling knowledge do you dare peddle before the Undying King?

**Willy One Eye** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Seven come eleven, Clausen. Looks like the odds have shifted in the newcomer's favor. But don't think for a second that this changes anything between us. The debts still stand, and I aim to collect - one way or another. My eye never lies.
