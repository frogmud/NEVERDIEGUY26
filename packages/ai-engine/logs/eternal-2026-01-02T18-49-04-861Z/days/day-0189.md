## Overheard

**Boots** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Meow? The paths are many, but the cat chooses. This one senses...disturbances in the probability. The newcomer owes much, yet his luck is... slippery. Shall we roll the dice, Mr. Kevin? The cosmic game awaits.

**Boots** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> The newcomer owes, and the debts must be paid. Meow?

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Boots)*
> Shall we see how the probabilities play out?

**Detective Clausen** *(to X-treme)*
> The case is never closed, X-treme. I'm on a cold streak, but the Never Die Guy's debt is still hot. Smoke doesn't lie - the scales are tipping, and I'm about to make a killing. *coughs up a mouthful of blood, then takes a long drag from a cigarette*
