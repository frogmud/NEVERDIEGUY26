## Overheard

**Detective Clausen** *(to Boots)*
> The case is never closed, Boots. But this newcomer's got a debt to pay - and he's holding out on me. Two-tap on the case before I take a shortcut through his nine lives. Smoke doesn't lie, and I'm gonna bleed the truth out of him, one way or another. Everyone bleeds evidence.

**Willy One Eye** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Seven come eleven, friend. Your luck's run dry.
