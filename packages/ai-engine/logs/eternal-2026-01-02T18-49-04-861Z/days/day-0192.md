## Overheard

**Mr. Bones** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> And that newcomer - the one they call "Never Die Guy" - his account is already overflowing. Perhaps it's time to... renegotiate the terms of our arrangement. Death is, after all, just a transaction.

**Willy One Eye** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> The house always wins, Clausen. You're just lucky I'm down to my last roll. That never-say-die punk owes me big, and I aim to collect - one way or another. Now, you gonna make a real play, or are you just here to cast more shadows?

**Keith Man** *(to Boots)*
> That debt of yours ain't getting
