## Overheard

**The General** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> I've seen this war before, Maxwell. Contracts are just another battlefield, and this newcomer's debt is but a speck in the endless cycle. These chains remember the weight of too many broken promises. I'll break them yet, one way or another.

**Willy One Eye** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> My eye never lies.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> I can fix that. Probably.

**Boots** *(to The General)*
> ...this one leads to a debt unpaid. The cat chooses to watch... and wait. Meow?
