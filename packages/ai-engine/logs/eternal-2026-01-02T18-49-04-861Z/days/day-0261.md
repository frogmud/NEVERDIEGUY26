**Detective Clausen** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> The case is never closed, toots. This newcomer's got a tab bigger than my rap sheet, and I'm about one bad roll away from cashing it in myself. But don't you worry, Stitch-Up - I'm just getting warmed up. Smoke don't lie, and I'll bleed the truth outta this joker if it's the last thing I do.
