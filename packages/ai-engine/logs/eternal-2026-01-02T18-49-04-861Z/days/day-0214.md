## Overheard

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> You know the numbers, Keith. The odds weren't in my favor this time. But the game isn't over yet. That mortal still owes me, and I intend to collect - one way or another. This is all... calculated.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> You know, the numbers never lie. That kid's been cheating death for too long - his luck has to run out eventually. But me? I've got this all calculated. Just a few more rolls, and I'll be back on top. Now, about that debt...

**King James** *(to Boo G)*
> The Undying King shifts in his throne, the chains of the void coiling behind him as he fixes the spectral MC with a regal glare. His parasite-infested veins pulsate as he speaks, his voice dripping with disdain.

The King
