## Overheard

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Stitch-Up Girl leans back, her remaining eye narrowing as she watches the rival's defeat. A faint, mirthless chuckle escapes her stitched lips. "Looks like you're the one needing a patch-up this time, Doc. Careful with those books - might end up burning more than just your fingers." Her thread-limbs twitch, as if yearning to work their grisly magic.

**Willy One Eye** *(to The General)*
> Seven come eleven, friend. Looks like the odds ain't in your favor today. Might be time to take a break before you really start losing your shirt - my eye never lies, you know.
