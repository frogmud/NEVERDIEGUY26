**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> The probability matrix suggests your ledgers are nothing but ash compared to the inferno of knowledge I possess! You owe me 200 gold, Bones - and if you don't pay up, I'll burn your precious tomes to cinders! This knowledge BURNS, and I'll see you reduced to a pile of bone fragments before I let it slip through my fingers!

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> The probability matrix suggests I'm on a hot streak of catastrophic losses, Mr. Bones! This newcomer's debt burns a hole in my pocket, and my books are mere kindling compared to the inferno of my fury. I'll throw the dice, but the knowledge I seek will surely reduce your ledgers to ash! *mutters calculations as smoke trails from his fingertips*
