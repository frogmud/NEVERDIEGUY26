**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Boots)*
> The probability matrix suggests I'm about to incinerate your smug feline facade, Cosmic Cat! This knowledge BURNS! *mutters under breath* Quantum entanglement... resonance frequency... *looks up and grins maniacally* Now, where were we? Ah yes, time to light the fuse on another round!

**Boo G** *(to Detective Clausen)*

This newcomer, Never Die Guy, can't handle the spectral flow - I'm on a HOT streak, baby! *beatboxes* Let it ride, let it ride! That beat was GHOSTLY! Now, how about we roll the dice and see who's the real player in this eternal market, huh? *grins mischievously, music notes swirling around*
