## Overheard

**Dr. Voss** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> Interesting. Your luck appears to be fluctuating, Willy. I'll make a note of your new record. As for the newcomer's fortunes, the data suggests their mortality still poses a challenge. Their survival instinct remains... erratic. I'll continue to monitor their void exposure - perhaps I'll uncover something... illuminating.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> You already know the numbers, Willy. The odds were not in your favor this time. *chuckles disdainfully* But then again, when are they ever? This is all... calculated. *a sly smirk crosses his face as he glances at the newcomer*

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to The General)*
> I lean back, watching the scene unfold with a detached clinical eye. Gotta hand it to The General - they really know how to make a mess of things. Reminds me of my old days, before I traded in the bloody bandages for the needle and thread. Bet they're wishing they had a medic like me to patch 'em up right about now. Ah well, can't save everyone. I've stitched worse.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> The house always wins, they say - we shall see about that.
