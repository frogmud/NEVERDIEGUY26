**Boots** *(to Keith Man)*
> One loss matters not. The cosmic dance continues.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Boots)*

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Boots)*

**Detective Clausen** *(to Keith Man)*
> The smoke curls from my lips as I tap my weathered briefcase twice, the scales forming in the hazy air. "Another resurrection, another bad beat.

I cast a sidelong glance at the smug speedster, my eyes narrowing as I contemplate my next move.
