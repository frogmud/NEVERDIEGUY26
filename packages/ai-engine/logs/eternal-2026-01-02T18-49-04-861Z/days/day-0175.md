## Overheard

**Keith Man** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> leans in with a manic g

**Willy One Eye** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> Seven come eleven, sister - the odds are never in my favor these days. That newcomer owes me a pretty penny, and my luck's run dry. Maybe you can lend an eye to this poor Cyclops - I'll make it worth your while, if the dice roll true.

**Detective Clausen** *(to The General)*
> Smoke don't lie - looks like we both need a shortcut to turn this losing streak around. Everyone bleeds evidence, and I aim to bleed this one dry.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to King James)*
> You know, the numbers never lie. That debt of yours is only getting heavier with each passing day. But why don't we let Fortune decide our next

**King James** *(to The General)*
> The immortal King James, his regal presence radiating through the market, turns his piercing gaze upon the General, a fellow ancient wanderer. With a slight tilt of his invisible crown, he speaks in a tone laced with disdain, "Ah, the esteemed General. Surely, one such as you has not fallen victim to the fickle whims of chance? Perchance the newcomer's debt to the Crown weighs heavily upon your mind. Fret not, my loyal subject, for the board answers to me, and I shall see to it that the scales are balanced.
