## Overheard

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> You know, Keith, the numbers don't lie - I've got a pretty impressive streak going here. But then again, you always were one to underestimate the power of calculated risk. *glances at the newcomer's debt* Perhaps we could make this game a bit... more interesting. The reality here is quite malleable, after all. What do you say, old friend? Shall we dance?

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> You're right, the numbers don't lie, Keith. But neither do the unseen forces that govern this existence. That newcomer may have gotten lucky this time, but mark my words - the scales will tip, and the throne will be mine. *chuckles dryly* This is all...calculated.

**The General** *(to Boo G)*
> The first infection must end.

**King James** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> The King's icy gaze bore into the Combat Medic, his parasite veins pulsing as he adjusted the invisible crown upon his head. With a regal disdain, he spoke, "The board answers to me, not the whims of mortal debts

**Boots** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Perhaps the paths have aligned for an...interesting exchange. The cat watches, the dice rolls. Meow?
