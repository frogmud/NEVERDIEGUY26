## Overheard

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> But then again, I always did enjoy a challenge. Let's see if you can keep up with the reality I've calculated.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> Well, I'm a patient man. The throne remains within my grasp.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> I believe he owes me a little something. This is all... calculated.

**King James** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> The Undying King reclines upon his ethereal throne, the chains of the void shifting restlessly behind him. With a regal disdain, he speaks, "The worm writhes, and the King watches. Let his fortunes dwindle, for he owes tribute to the crown. Death was merely a promotion, and the board answers to me." His parasite-laced veins pulse as he adjusts the invisible crown upon his brow, a sardonic smile playing upon his lips.

**King James** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> The Undying King leans back in his throne, the chains behind it writhing with a malevolent energy. His parasite-infested skull glares down at the wretched accountant, his voice dripping with royal disdain. 

"Ah, Death's ledger-keeper. The King's luck is as fickle as the winds, but the newcomer's debt to the crown remains. Perhaps you should tend to your own abysmal record before daring to cross the Undying King.
