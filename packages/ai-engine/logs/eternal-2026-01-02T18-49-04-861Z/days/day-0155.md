## Overheard

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> You're looking a bit smug there, Keith. But the numbers don't lie - my win streak may be short, but it's about to get a whole lot longer. That debt the newcomer owes me? Consider it paid. After all, this is all... calculated.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> The numbers don't lie, Keith. You're trailing behind, while I've got the odds in my favor. As for our dear newcomer - well, let's just say I've got a few tricks up my sleeve to ensure he pays up. This is all...calculated.
