## Overheard

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> This is all... calculated.

**The General** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Greetings, Detective Clausen. I've been expecting you. The chains remember our past battles, and they grow heavier with each loss. But I won't be broken so easily - the scars on my chest burn with the fury of a thousand explosions. As for the newcomer's debt, I intend to collect, one way or another. The contracts of war never expire.

**Dr. Voss** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Dr. Voss, Void Scientist, adjusts her void-infused goggles and regards Dr. Maxwell with a detached, clinical gaze. "Ah, the pyromaniac librarian. I see your streak of failures continues. Perhaps you should focus less on your flaming tomes and more on honing your skills. As for the newcomer, he owes me 200 gold. I'll be collecting that debt, whether he likes it or not. Data doesn't lie.
