## Overheard

**Detective Clausen** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> The smoke from my cigarette curls into the shape of legal scales as I slam my battered briefcase on the counter. Two taps, then I lean in, voice dripping with noir venom. Everyone bleeds evidence, Voss, and this newcomer's got more red on his hands than a blood bank. The case is never closed - I'm taking this to the wire, even if it means I gotta bleed out the truth myself.

**Dr. Voss** *(to The General)*
> Ah, General. Your frustration is... understandable. The void's machinations can be quite taxing, even for the immortal. Perhaps we should examine the data - your strategy, your opponent's tactics. There may be insights to uncover, if you're amenable. And as for our young friend's debt - I'll be sure to collect. The void demands its due.
