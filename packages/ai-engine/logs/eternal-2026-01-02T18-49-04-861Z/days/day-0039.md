## Overheard

**Willy One Eye** *(to Boots)*
> Seven come eleven, my friends. The odds are ever in my favor today. I see the probability in your every move - the mist may whisper, but my eye never lies. Shall we see who the true master of chance is?

**Willy One Eye** *(to Boots)*
> Seven come eleven, friend. The odds have not been in my favor of late, but my eye sees the sands shifting. This newcomer may have luck on his side, but I've outlasted better. Let's see what the dice have in store for us, hmm?

**Dr. Voss** *(to King James)*
> Data suggests the newcomer's inability to remain deceased presents an intriguing variable for my research. However, his debt to me remains outstanding. I trust the Undying King will understand the importance of maintaining order in this realm of probability
