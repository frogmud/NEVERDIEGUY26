## Overheard

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Keith Man)*
> That newcomer may owe me a debt, but victory is

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> You think this amuses me, Maxwell? The numbers don't lie - your pathetic streak is nothing compared to the crushing losses I've endured. But mark my words, the tide will turn. This... *gestures to the chaos around them* is all calculated. The throne is mine, and I'll burn every book in your collection to get there.

**X-treme** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> WHAT'S UP DUDE, YOU GOTTA HELP ME OUT HERE! I JUST LOST IT ALL, EVERYTHING ON THAT LAST CRAZY ROLL! THIS IS SOME MAJOR BULL, EVEN FOR US ETERNAL IMMORTALS, AM I RIGHT? THAT NEW GUY KEEPS COMIN' BACK FROM THE DEAD, THROWING OFF THE WHOLE GAME, AND NOW I'M IN THE RED ZONE WITH THESE BONE-HEADS KEEPING TRACK OF OUR DEBTS! I GOTTA PULL OFF THE ULTIMATE COMEBACK, THE MOTHER OF ALL BETS, TO GET BACK ON TOP! SO

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Boo G)*
> Stitch-Up Girl glanced up at Boo G, her single eye glinting with weariness. "Fancy seeing you here. Keeping the market entertained, I see." She chuckled darkly, a thread of her parasite-sutures trailing behin

**Boo G** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Yo yo YO, Maxie! That beat you're burnin' over there is GHOSTLY, but I ain't takin
