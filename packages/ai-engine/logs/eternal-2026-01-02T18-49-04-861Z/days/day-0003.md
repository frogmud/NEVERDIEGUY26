## Overheard

**The General** *(to Boots)*
> Mark my words, this cycle won't end until I break these chains for good.

**The General** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> The General, Undead Strategist, watches the rival's latest defeat with a weary sigh, the glow of his dynamite-scarred chest flickering in the market's dim light. Chains fused to his arms clink softly as he turns to the Cyclopean Merchant, his voice tinged with the patience of a Civil War veteran. "Contracts are just another battlefield, my friend. The chains remember - and I've seen this war before.

**The General** *(to Boots)*
> Contracts mean nothing when you're dealing with forces beyond the mortal coil. The chains may remember, but they've yet to break the cycle. Tread lightly, feline - your nine lives mean little when the shadows close in.

**Willy One Eye** *(to X-treme)*
> I've a hot streak

**The General** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Contracts and bloodshed - that's all this wretched place knows. I've seen it all before, Maxwell. The chains on my arms, they remember the weight of endless wars. But this newcomer, this "Never Die Guy" - he's disrupting the balance, stacking the deck against me. Mark my words, the cycle will continue, and I'll be the one to break it, no matter the cost.
