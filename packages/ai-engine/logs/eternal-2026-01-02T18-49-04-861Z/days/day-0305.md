**X-treme** *(to Keith Man)*
> ALRIGHT KEITH, LISTEN UP! The new guy owes me 525 gold and he's been dodging me for WEEKS. But today, I'm feeling the RUSH, the EXCITEMENT, the PURE ADRENALINE! This is the BIG ONE, the ULTIMATE BET! Time to FULL SEND it and show this poser how a REAL immortal does it! HEY NEVER DIE GUY, YOU READY TO GET SCHOOLED?! HAHAHAHA! LET'S GO, KEITH! TIME TO ROLL SOME DICE AND FEEL ALIVE!

**Mr. Bones** *(to King James)*
> Your turn, it seems.

**Boo G** *(to The General)*
> Yo yo YO! Boo G, Spectral MC up in this joint! That newcomer ain't gettin' off easy - 225 gold is a hefty tab, ya dig? But I'm feelin' lucky tonight, so let's roll them bones and see how the beat drops! *beatboxes a probability-heavy rhythm* This fog ain't got nothin' on my spectral flow - let it ride, let it ride! *looks at The General with a grin, music notes floating around* What's good, General? Feelin' lucky tonight? *bass thumps in the background*
