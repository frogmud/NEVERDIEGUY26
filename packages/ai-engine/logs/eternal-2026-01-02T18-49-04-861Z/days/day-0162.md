## Overheard

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to The General)*
> Let's just hope the next round goes better, for both our sakes.

**The General** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> The newcomer owes me more than gold. He owes me answers. And I aim to collect, one way or another.

**The General** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> I've got nothing left to lose, Maxwell. That upstart owes me more than his life's worth, and I'll be damned if I let him walk away scot-free. The chains remember, and they're hungry for fresh meat. Contracts are just another battlefield, and this one's about to get explosive.
