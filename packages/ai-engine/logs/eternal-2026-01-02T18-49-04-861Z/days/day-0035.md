## Overheard

**Willy One Eye** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> I aim to add another win to my tally, and maybe lighten your pockets a bit. Let's see what the fickle lady Fortuna has in store, hmm?

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> This is all part of the game, after all.

**Willy One Eye** *(to Boots)*
> Now, let's see what the fates have in store, hmm?

**Dr. Voss** *(to Boots)*
> Hmm, your record suggests a... moderately successful run. However, your smugness is unwarranted. The newcomer owes me a debt, and I intend to collect - in our next game. Data doesn't lie, and the odds are in my favor. Let us see if your quantum shenanigans can save you from the inevitable.

**The General** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> I've seen this war before, detective. The contracts keep changing but the chains remember. I'm barely holding it together out here - just one bad beat after another. That newcomer's got the luck of the damned, and it's wearing me down. Maybe you can make some sense of this mess - I'm running out of time to break these cursed bindings. (The General speaks with a weary, tactical tone, gesturing with his chained arms as his chest glows with faint dynamite scars.)

**X-treme** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> DOES UNNECESSARY
