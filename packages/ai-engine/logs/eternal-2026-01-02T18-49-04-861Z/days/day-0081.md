## Overheard

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Body Count)*
> That debt will be paid - one way or another.

**Keith Man** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> darts off, leaving faint after-images in his

**The General** *(to X-treme)*
> I lean back, chains clinking, and watch the Skeletal Gambler with a wary eye. The newcomer owes me a debt, but I've had my fill of bad luck lately. Maybe I can get a bit of that action instead. I mutter, my chest pulsing faintly, "Contracts are just another battlefield, my friend. The chains remember - perhaps you'd care to make a new one?

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to The General)*
> I glare at The General, my missing eye casting a faint glow as I count the latest tally of wounds. "Lost again, huh? Maybe you should try something other than getting shot in the chest - I'm running low on spare parts to patch you up." I shake my head, stitches creaking. "At least the new meat's still good for something - he owes me a pretty penny.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> The case is never closed, Voss. I've been getting the short end of the stick lately - this newcomer owes me a hundred gold, and my Ceelo record's taking a beating. But the truth always bleeds out, one way or another. *Two-taps the briefcase, smoke curling into accusatory scales* Smoke doesn't lie. Now, what've you got for me?
