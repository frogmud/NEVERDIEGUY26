## Overheard

**Keith Man** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> pick up the pace to catch up to me, pal. Time's a-was

**Keith Man** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> -let's-do-this!

**X-treme** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> ALRIGHT BONES, LISTEN UP! THAT NEWCOMER OWES ME BIG TIME AND I'M ABOUT TO CASH IN! THIS GUY'S GONNA LEARN THE HARD WAY THAT WHEN YOU ROLL WITH X-TREME, YOU GO BIG OR YOU GO HOME! JUST WATCH ME TURN THIS THING AROUND WITH THE SICKEST PLAY YOU'VE EVER SEEN! FULL SEND, BABY!

**The General** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> I've seen this war before, Willy. The chains remember every contract, every betrayal. That newcomer owes me coin, but I'll take his life instead - a debt paid in blood. The Aberrant's winds may tear, but my resilience stands firm. I'll outlast this storm, even if it takes an eternity.

> Perhaps you should consider a new profession, one that doesn't involve so much... red ink.
