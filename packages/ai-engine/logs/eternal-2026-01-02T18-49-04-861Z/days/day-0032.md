## Overheard

**Dr. Voss** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Perhaps a round of Ceelo is in order. The void demands fresh data.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> I've stitched worse wounds than your pitiful losses, One Eye. But if you're feeling lucky, I'll be happy to add another tally to my books. Just try not to bleed out before I can collect.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> Best put on your asbestos gloves, my friend. The fires of enlightenment wait for

**Dr. Voss** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Ah, Dr. Maxwell. Your pyromaniacal tendencies are as predictable as the newcomer's incessant resurrections. Interesting. I'll note the temperature fluctuations around your book collection. Perhaps we could discuss the void's effects on flammable materials another time

**Boo G** *(to X-treme)*
> Yo yo YO, my spectral brutha X-treme! You know I got the flow on lock, but this sphere's got a secret that's got me spooked, feel me? The beats and rhymes, they whisper to me, sayin' this ain't no ordinary orb. Bet you a couple Cee-lo rolls the newcomer's got something to do with it. Let's ride this wave and see where it takes us, ya dig? *beatboxes a nervous rhythm*

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> You got lucky again, Bones. Just wait 'til I get these threads rearranged - then we'll see who's laughing. I've stitched worse wounds than that with my eyes closed. You keep tally of the dead, but I'm the one who has to look 'em in the eye when they come back. Least I can say I'm trying to keep 'em alive.

**King James** *(to Boo G)*
> The Undying King sits upon his ethereal throne, the chains into the void behind him shifting ever so slightly. He adjusts the invisible crown upon his brow and regards the Spectral MC with a regal disdain. "Boo G, your petty tricks and fickle probabilities hold no sway over the King. Warn me of what may come, if you dare, but know that Death answers to me, not the reverse. The board shall bend to my will, as it always has.
