## Overheard

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Body Count)*
> As for that debt... well, I'm sure we can come to an arrangement. This is all... calculated.

**X-treme** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> YOOOO WILLY, my EYEBALL BROTHER! *does a sick kickflip* Looks like your competition just lost the farm! *rattles bones excitedly* Time to RIDE THE GRAVY TRAIN, bro! *pumps fist* The NEVER DIE GUY is about to find out what happens when you play with the big skeletons! *grins wide, revealing rows of jagged teeth* Time to DOUBLE DOWN and SEND IT, my dude! WOOOOO! *whoops and hollers*

**X-treme** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> WHAT'S UP, STITCH-UP GIRL? MY STREAK'S EVEN, BUT THAT'S ABOUT TO CHANGE - I'M FEELING LUCKY TODAY! LET'S THROW DOWN

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Dr. Voss)*

**Boo G** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> , if you ask me. Let it ride, let it ride - the house always wins in the end!

**King James** *(to Keith Man)*
> The King observes the spectacle with a dispassionate gaze, his invisible crown glinting in the torchlight as he leans back upon his throne of void-bound chains. A ghost of a smirk plays upon his lips as he regards the Temporal Speedster, his voice dripping with regal disdain. The newcomer's debt to the crown shall not be forgotten - the board answers to him, and him alone.
