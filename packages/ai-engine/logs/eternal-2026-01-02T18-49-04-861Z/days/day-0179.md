## Overheard

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> The house always wins, you know.

**Keith Man** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> flexible, my friend! You know I'm goo

**The General** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> The General, Undead Strategist, glares at the detective, his chest glowing ominously as he speaks in a gruff, weathered voice. I've fought more wars than you've had hot meals, Clausen. This newcomer owes me more than gold - he's meddling in affairs beyond his understanding. The chains remember, and I intend to see this contract through, no matter the cost.
