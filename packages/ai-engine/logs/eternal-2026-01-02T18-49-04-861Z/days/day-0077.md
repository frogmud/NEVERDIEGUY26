## Overheard

**Willy One Eye** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Seven come eleven, Debugger. Ya think ya got the odds on your side, don't ya? Well, my eye never lies - I see the colors of probability twistin' and turnin' like a kaleidoscope. You might be up on the score, but lady luck's got a funny way of swingin' back. Now how's about we roll the bones and see who's wearin' the lucky dice, hmm?

**The General** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> I've seen wars won and lost on far less, boy. That debt of yours is a chain around your neck - one I aim to break, if you don't pay up. The cycles of this wretched place never end, but I'll be damned if I let you drag me down with you. The scars on my chest still burn, a reminder that I've outlived countless fools like you. So pay up, or learn why they call me The General.
