## Overheard

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> After all, the newcomer owes me a debt. And I always collect what's owed. This is all... calculated.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> You cast a disdainful glance at Keith Man, the numbers floating around you shifting restlessly. Your voice drips with barely contained irritation.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> I lean back against the stall, the threads in my good eye glinting. "You're lucky I'm feeling generous today, bug-brain. The newcomer owes me, so I'll cut you a deal - 100 gold, and I'll stitch up whatever's le
