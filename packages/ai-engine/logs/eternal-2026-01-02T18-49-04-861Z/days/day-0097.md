## Overheard

**The General** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> The General, Undead Strategist, leans in with a weary gaze, his chest glowing faintly like dynamite scars. "Contracts and debts, Mr. Bones - they're the only constants in this endless war. That newcomer owes me a hundred gold, and I'll have it, one way or another. The chains remember, and so do I." His voice, thick with the burden of centuries, carries a hint of menace.

**Mr. Bones** *(to The General)*
> Ah, the General - always a pleasure to witness the ebb and flow of mortality. I must say, your debt seems to be piling up, my friend. Perhaps you should consider a career change - being a strategist is clearly not your forte. As for me, I've got a bone to pick with this "Never Die Guy" - his account is woefully overdue, and I intend to collect. Death is just a transaction, after all.
