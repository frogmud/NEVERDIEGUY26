## Overheard

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> You already know the numbers, Keith. This is all just a probability game - and I'm still winning. That debt of his? It's merely a blip on the radar. Just watch, the odds will turn in my favor soon enough. The newcomer can't hide from the reality I've calculated. This tilted streak is but a temporary setback. The throne is still mine to claim.

**Keith Man** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Better cough up

**Mr. Kevin** *(to The General)*
> The show must go on, after all.
