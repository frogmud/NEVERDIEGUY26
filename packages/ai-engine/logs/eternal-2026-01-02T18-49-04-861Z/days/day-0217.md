## Overheard

**Boots** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> The cat's paw leaves ashen trails, marking the pathways of fate. 175 gold is owed, but the cosmic game continues. My streak may be broken, but the probability curves in my favor. Meow?

**Keith Man** *(to Boots)*
> Gotta-go-gotta-go

**Boo G** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Yo yo YO, Detective Clausen! That last roll was WACK, straight up! Shoulda known Lady Luck was feelin' fickle today - these spectral flows ain't always in my favor, y'know? Gotta keep the hustle goin', though, can't let a few losses get me down. Maybe we can find a way to turn this around, yeah? Just say the word and let's make some MUSIC!

**Detective Clausen** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> Smoke doesn't lie - the numbers don't add up, and I'm running out of shortcuts to make it right.
