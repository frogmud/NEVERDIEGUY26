## Overheard

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*

> Consider it

**Keith Man** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Gotta-go-gotta-go-gotta-go, Kev--*twitch* Keith! *vibrates* The house always wins, ain't that right, Mr. Reality Debugger? *chuckles* 125 gold, eh? *speaks in Kevin's voice* I'll pay it back... *quickly switches to own voice* when time decides! *laughs manically and disappears in a blur*
