## Overheard

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> I believe you owe me 200 gold. The newcomer's debt can wait - I have a streak to maintain.

**Keith Man** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> little win streak

**Detective Clausen** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> Two-tap on the case before I take another shortcut. The newcomer's got some explaining to do - and I ain't leaving until I get my gold.

**X-treme** *(to King James)*
> THAT WAS SICK! So, what's the deal, bro? I'm ready to risk it ALL for the RUSH! BRING IT ON!

**Mr. Bones** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Ah, Dr. Maxwell - it seems the flame of your luck has been extinguished once more. A pity, truly - though I must say, your debt to the cold embrace of Death only grows with each passing wager. Perchance you'd care to make a deal and settle your account? I have a bone to pick with you, after all...
