## Overheard

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Body Count)*
> The newcomer may have gotten lucky, but I've got centuries of experience on my side. Watch your back, Silent Assassin - the throne is mine.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> Who knows, maybe the house is about to get shaken up. After all, the newcomer's been stirring things up quite a bit, wouldn't you say?

**Keith Man** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> ...flexible.

**King James** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> The Undying King's chains rattle as he leans forward, his parasite-infested gaze boring into the skeletal Death's Accountant. The King's voice drips with regal disdain, "Pitiful creature, dare you trifle with the fortunes of one such as I? The board answers to my whims, not the other way around. This mere 'streak' is but a momentary setback - the King does not lose, for death was merely a promotion.
