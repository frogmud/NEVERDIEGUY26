## Overheard

**The General** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> I've seen this dance too many times, Willy. The newcomer owes me a debt, and I'll be damned if I let these chains hold me back any longer. Contracts are just another battlefield, and I plan to win this war - even if I have to rip open my own explosive veins to do it. The cycles must end, one way or another.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> loose ends.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to The General)*
> I lean back, my one good eye narrowing as I watch the carnage unfold. I've seen this play out before - the prideful fall, the desperation, the final reckoning. Absently, I run a thread-tipped finger along the stitches lining my jawline, the cold metal glint of my missing eye catching the light. You know the drill, General - the house always wins. I'm just here to clean up the mess. *cracks knuckles* Now, about that debt...
