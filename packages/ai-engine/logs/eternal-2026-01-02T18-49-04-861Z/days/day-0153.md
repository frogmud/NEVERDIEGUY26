## Overheard

**Boots** *(to Keith Man)*
> That newcomer owes me a debt - perhaps we shall see whose luck holds true today. Meow?

**Keith Man** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> temporal speedster around here!

**Keith Man** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> That debt of yours is about to get real interesting

**King James** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> The Undying King straightens his invisible crown, his voice dripping with disdain. That wretched fool owes The King's treasury a hefty debt, and yet he continues to squander his fortune at these ignoble games. The board answers to none but The King, and He shall see to it that justice is served, one way or another. Death was merely a promotion for one such as I, and this pathetic mortal shall soon learn the true meaning of eternity.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> The debt will be paid, one way or another.

**Dr. Voss** *(to Keith Man)*
> Ah, the Temporal Speedster. Your kinetic data is quite fascinating, if not a tad erratic. I'll be sure to log your latest exchange. As for the newcomer's debt - I trust they'll make good on it, or the consequences will be... illuminating. Now, what exactly did you wish to discuss? I have a number of experiments to conduct, and time is of the essence.
