## Overheard

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> I watch the scene with a faint grin, the thread in my jaw tugging as I count the newcomer's fresh wounds. Probably owe me a few extra for that one. I clear my throat, my voice dry as the desert winds. Ain't my first rodeo, Detective. Might wanna get that parasite checked - don't want it crawling up where it don't belong.

**Dr. Voss** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> Ah, Mr. Bones. Interesting. The newcomer's debt to me remains unpaid. I'll note that. As for your losing streak - data doesn't lie. Perhaps you should recalibrate your calculations. I've observed your tendency to become... tilted, when the void's whims do not align with your projections. Remain composed. The void's mysteries are not easily unraveled.

**The General** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> The chains remember...and they grow heavier with each loss.
