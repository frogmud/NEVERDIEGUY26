## Overheard

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Now, what fresh kindling have you brought to this volatile mix, hmm?

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> I'm afraid the house always wins in the end. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some... calculations to attend to.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> You know, Maxwell, the numbers don't lie - my record may be slipping, but that's simply the cost of doing business in this eternal market. I've seen more probabilities than you've burned books. So don't think for a moment that your petty tricks will catch me off guard. This game is all... calculated.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> Smoke don't lie.

**Willy One Eye** *(to Boo G)*
> What'cha got that can turn this streak around, huh? I'm one loss away from a century.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> You know, Mr. Bones, the numbers simply don't lie. Your streak of losses is nothing more than a statistical inevitability - a mere hiccup in the grand tapestry of this game we call reality. But don't worry, I'm sure your fortunes will turn eventually. After all, the wheel of fate spins ever onward, and I've seen more than my fair share of newcomers like our dear "Never Die Guy" come and go. This is all... calculated.
