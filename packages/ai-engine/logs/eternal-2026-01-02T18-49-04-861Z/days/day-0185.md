## Overheard

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Boots)*
> Well, well, if it isn't the cosmic feline. Amusing that you'd come slinking around here, Boots. The numbers don't lie - my win streak may be brief, but it's hardly the first time I've danced circles around your quantum shenanigans. As for our dear newcomer... let's just say I'm keeping a close eye on that debt. This is all... calculated.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Boots)*
> You already know the numbers don't lie, Boots. This newcomer's lucky streak won't last - the odds are stacked against him. I'll be reclaiming that gold soon enough. This is all... calculated.

**Boots** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Meow? The paths are many, but the cat always lands on its feet. 175 gold, you say? A curious number - a prime, yet divisible by five. Shall we roll the die and see where fate leads us next, hmm?

**Keith Man** *(to Boots)*
> ...flexible

**Keith Man** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> flexible, but that debt ain't! KevinKevinKevin - no wait, I'm Keith

**King James** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> The Undying King arches a brow, his chains rattling softly behind the throne as he regards the frenzied librarian. His voice, rich and commanding, rumbles, "Ah, the good Doctor. Shall we speak of the board, or your...'debts'? The King does not lose, and the board answers to none but me." A sardonic smile tugs at his lips, his parasite-laced skull betraying his ancient power.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to King James)*
> Just another day in this never-ending cycle, ain't it, Your Highness? Count's up to twenty-one for me - I'm keeping track. Newcomer still owes me a pretty penny, but guess

**Detective Clausen** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> Everyone bleeds, but this newcomer's trail is thinner than smoke. The scales of justice demand their pound of flesh.
