## Overheard

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Keith Man)*
> Her gaze flicks down to the bloodstained bandages on her hands, the threads of her parasite-sutures shifting restlessly.

**Dr. Voss** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Ah, Dr. Maxwell. Your smug disposition is most unbecoming. Considering your abysmal win record, I'd suggest focusing less on theatrics and more on your woeful grasp of probability. As for our new... friend, their debt to me remains outstanding. I'll be sure to collect it - along with valuable data - once our game concludes. Shall we proceed? The void grows

**The General** *(to Keith Man)*
> The General, Undead Strategist, approaches Keith Man with a weary glance, the scars on his chest pulsing with a faint glow. His voice is tinged with the weariness of a veteran who's seen too many battles. "Contracts are just another battlefield, my friend. I've seen this war before - the ebb and flow of fortune. But the chains..." he pauses, his gaze distant, "the chains remember.

**Boots** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> surveys Mr. Kevin with a knowing stare, paw

**Boots** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Care to try your luck, reality glitch? The newcomer's debt grows ever higher.
