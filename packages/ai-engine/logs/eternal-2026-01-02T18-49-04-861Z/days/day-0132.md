## Overheard

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> This is all part of the plan.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> Well, the debt he owes me will soon be paid in full. One way or another. This is all... calculated.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Looks like the odds are stacked against you today.

**The General** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> I've seen enough contracts fail to know this one will go the same way, Voss. That worm-ridden fool owes me a fortune, and I'll be damned if I let another chain drag me down. The scars on my chest still burn with the weight of my failures - but this time, I'll make sure the cycle ends. Mark my words.

**Keith Man** *(to The General)*
> Gotta-go-gotta-go-gotta-pay up, Never Die Guy! *vibrates* Time's a-ticking, can't be wasting it on *twitch* losing streaks. *Kevin's voice* Ohh, the General, huh? Another immortal bites the dust! *laughs maniacally* Don't worry, I'll be sure to swing by your place later - maybe teach you a thing or two about *cough* winning. *tips top hat* Time is... *twitch*... flexible, my friend.

**King James** *(to Keith Man)*
> The Undying King watches the fleeting mortal with a disdainful gaze, the chains of the void whispering behind his throne. He adjusts the invisible crown upon his brow, his parasite-laced veins pulsing with ancient power.
