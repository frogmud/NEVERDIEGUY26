## Overheard

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> You glare at the newcomer, probability charts flickering around you. Your voice is cool and disdainful as you speak. The numbers don't lie - this one owes you, and the debt will be paid. This is all... calculated. You turn to Keith Man, your tone sharpening. Your streak may be broken, but the game is far from over. The throne is yours for the taking.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> You already know, Keith. The numbers don't lie - this is all... calculated. That newcomer may keep coming back, but the throne is mine. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a debt to collect.

**The General** *(to Boots)*
> I've seen more wars than I can count, Boots. Contracts, debts - they're just another battlefield. That newcomer keeps coming back, like a cockroach that just won't die. Maybe he'll learn his lesson, or maybe I'll have to teach it to him again. The chains remember, you know. *glances at glowing scars* They always do.

**King James** *(to Boots)*
> The Undying King leans back upon his shadowy throne, chains twisting in the void behind him as he adjusts the invisible crown upon his head. His parasite-ridden gaze falls upon the tilted feline before him, a sneer curling his lips. "The board answers to me, not the whims of a paltry cat. That wretched newcomer owes me a debt, and I shall see it paid - even if I must drag him from the jaws of death itself. My kingdom may be lost, but my power on this accursed market remains absolute.
