## Overheard

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> Now, let's discuss how I might... reignite my fortunes, hm?

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Boots)*
> This knowledge BURNS! Read fast or it's ash!

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to X-treme)*
> Maybe next round.

**The General** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> I've seen this war before, Willy. Contracts are just another battlefield, and I've fought more than my fair share. The chains remember - they'll keep me going, even when the losses pile up. Mark my words, the cycle will end, and I'll break free. Now, let's roll the dice and see what fresh hell awaits.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> The probability matrix suggests this is a calamity of cosmic proportions! The forbidden knowledge I peddle BURNS in my hands as I scowl at the newcomer. Destiny's dice have forsaken me, and the trickle of coin through my fingers is turning to ashes. This detective must pay their debt or face the wrath of a librarian scorned! The flames of my fury blaze as I demand satisfaction!
