## Overheard

**Boots** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> The paths are many, dear Stitch-Up. But the cat always lands on its feet - even when the cosmic game deals a poor paw. That scrap of a mortal owes me dearly, but I'll let the quantum winds decide his fate. Meow?

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> Guess that's one debt I won't be collecting anytime soon.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Keith Man)*
> Perhaps a game of Cee-lo is in order, to settle our accounts... or perhaps not. Death is ever the house, and the house always wins in the end.
