## Overheard

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Boots)*
> The streak ends here. I've got this.

**King James** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> The King resists the urge to adjust his invisible crown as the mortal approaches, his parasite veins crawling beneath the surface. The immortal's gaze sweeps over the newcomer with disdain, a hint of amusement in his tone. The board may answer

**Willy One Eye** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> Ah, the good doctor! Your toys don't interest me, Voss. I've got a hot streak to break - these dice have a mind of their own, but my eye never lies. Seven come eleven, that's all I need. Probability's a fickle mistress, but I'll dance with her 'til the end. This newcomer thinks he can best me, but I've been playing this game since before his grandpappy was a glimmer in the cosmos. Now, you got anything worth my time, or are we just wasting each other's eternal existence?
