## Overheard

**Mr. Bones** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Ah, Mr. Reality Debugger, we meet again. I must say, the heat is starting to get under my skin - though I suppose that's only fitting, given my line of work. As for our mutual friend here, his debt remains quite...overdue. Perhaps we should discuss a payment plan before the final tally comes due, hmm?

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> This is all... calculated. Now, Dr. Maxwell, how about we make a little wager? The odds are in my favor, I assure you.

**King James** *(to X-treme)*
> The Undying King shifts in his throne, the chains behind him writhing as he regards the Skeletal Gambler with disdain. His parasite-ridden skull twitches as he speaks, voice dripping with royal authority.
