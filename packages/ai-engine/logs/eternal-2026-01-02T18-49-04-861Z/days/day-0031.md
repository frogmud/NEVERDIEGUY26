## Overheard

**X-treme** *(to King James)*
> YO KING JAMES, WHAT'S GOOD?! HEARD YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOME EXTREME ACTION! WELL YOU'VE COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE, MY

**King James** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> The King does not lose, detective! Merely a temporary setback in a game that has spanned centuries. My royal bloodline answers to no one, not even the fickle whims of chance. This newcomer may have caught me off guard, but mark my words - the board will soon kneel before the immortal sovereign once more. Now, away with your petty inquiries - the King has more pressing matters to attend.

**The General** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> I've seen too many of these contracts end in blood, Willy. The chains remember - I'll break this cycle, even if I have to rip the guts from that newcomer myself. Heh, maybe that'll finally put an end to this cursed streak. *the General's glowing scars pulse with a dull light as he speaks*
