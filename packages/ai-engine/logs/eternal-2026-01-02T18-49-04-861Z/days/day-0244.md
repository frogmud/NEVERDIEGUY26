## Overheard

**Boo G** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> Yo yo YO, Stitch-Up! Lookin' sharp as ever, girl. That cold presence ain't stoppin' this spectral MC from layin' down some GHOSTLY flows, ya dig?

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Keith Man)*
> The probability matrix suggests your luck has run dry, Keith Man. Perhaps you should let the fires of knowledge consume your debts - after all, the only currency that truly matters is what burns in the mind! This newcomer owes me more than gold - he owes me the secrets of the cosmos! *mutters calculations as books smolder in his hands* Read fast, or it's all ash!

**X-treme** *(to King James)*
> ALRIGHT DUDE, LISTEN UP! THIS NEWCOMER'S REALLY HARSHING MY VIBE, ALWAYS DYING AND COMING BACK LIKE SOME KIND OF IMMORTAL REJECT! BUT HEY, THAT JUST MEANS MORE SICK BETS FOR ME TO TAKE! I'LL TELL YA WHAT, KING JAMES - I'M GONNA MAKE THIS NEWCOMER PAY UP THAT 300 GOLD, AND THEN WE'RE GONNA TAKE IT ALL IN THE BIGGEST, MOST EXTREME GAME OF CEELO YA EVER SEEN! FULL SEND, BABY! GO BIG OR GO HOME!
