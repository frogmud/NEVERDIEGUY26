## Overheard

**Boots** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> As for our game, I'll take your gold - and your pride. The cat has many lives, but you've yet to learn how to cheat death. Meow?

**Boots** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> This newcomer owes me

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Let's make this transaction quick, before the knowledge within turns to ash

**The General** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> I've seen this war before, Maxwell. The newcomer owes me a debt, but winning won't ease the chains that bind me. The cycle continues, no matter how much dynamite I shove in my veins. Contracts are just another battlefield, and I'm running out of time to break them.

**Dr. Voss** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Ah, Detective Clausen. Your emotional volatility is a fascinating data point. Perhaps we could discuss the nuances of your "tilted" state - I'd be most interested to analyze the physiological responses underlying your frustration. As for the newcomer's debt, I assure you the data will be collected, one way or another. My research into the void's influence on the mortal psyche continues unabated.

**Willy One Eye** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> Maybe the newcomer'll fare better. Or maybe not. Either way, the house always wins in the end.
