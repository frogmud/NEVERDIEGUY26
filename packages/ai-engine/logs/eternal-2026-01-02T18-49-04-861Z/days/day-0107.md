## Overheard

**Keith Man** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Uh, I mean...

**The General** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> At least we have each other, for now.

**Detective Clausen** *(to The General)*
> Looks like we both need a win. How about we make this one a real bloodbath?

**The General** *(to King James)*
> Ah, the Undying King. A fellow immortal, weathered by these endless wars. While my luck has been sorely tested of late, I cannot help but observe the ebb and flow of fate. That newcomer owes me a debt - a contract, if you will. Perhaps he could be persuaded to settle it, lest the chains remember his transgressions. As for you, Your Majesty, I trust our paths will cross again on the ever-shifting battlefield of this market. The scars on my chest pulse with the rhythm of this endless conflict.
