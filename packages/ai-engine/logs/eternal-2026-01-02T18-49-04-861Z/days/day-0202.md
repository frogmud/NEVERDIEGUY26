## Overheard

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Boots)*
> You already know the numbers, Boots. The odds are in our favor - and I intend to keep it that way. This newcomer owes me a debt, and I plan to collect. *smirks confidently* Let's show them how the game is really played.

**Boots** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> smirks, paw smears

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Boots)*
> You already know the numbers don't lie, Boots. This newcomer's lucky streak won't last - the odds are firmly in my favor. As for you, Cosmic Cat... let's see if your smug confidence holds up when I reclaim my rightful place atop the throne. This is all... calculated.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Boots)*
> The numbers don't lie, Boots. The newcomer's luck can't last forever. I've been playing this game longer than you've been alive - my winning streak may have stumbled, but it's only a matter of time before the odds realign in my favor. This is all... calculated.

**The General** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> I've seen this dance before, Mr. Kevin. The newcomer thinks he's invincible, but the chains remember. That debt of his? It's not going anywhere. Maybe you and I can change the tune of this endless waltz - for a price.

**Dr. Voss** *(to The General)*
> Ah, the General. Your losses do not surprise me. Predictable, really. The newcomer's debt remains unpaid, and my research continues unimpeded. Shall we discuss strategy, or would you prefer to observe a controlled void experiment? I have a hypothesis that requires further testing.
