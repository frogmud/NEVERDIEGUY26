## The Newcomer
> died on ante 1, rescued by Dr. Maxwell

## Overheard

**Dr. Voss** *(to X-treme)*
> Interesting. The newcomer's reappearance is... predictable. His debt remains unpaid, and his survival instincts are clearly lacking. I'll make a note of his consistent failure to adapt.

**King James** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> The Undying King James adjusts his invisible crown with a disdainful sneer, his parasite veins crawling across his skull as he speaks. Leaning back upon his throne, he regards the void scientist with detached interest. Ah, the good doctor - a fellow immortal who has yet to learn the true mastery of the board. The newcomer's debt shall be repaid, in time. For the King's luck answers to none but himself.
