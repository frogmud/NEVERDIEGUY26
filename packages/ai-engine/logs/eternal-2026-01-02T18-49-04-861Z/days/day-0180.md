## Overheard

**Boots** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> 175 gold is a mere trifle - just wait until the streak ends, my friend. Fate has a way of balancing the scales.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Boots)*
> This is all... calculated. The newcomer's debt will be repaid, one way or another.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Boots)*
> The debt he owes me is mere child's play, a trifle in the grand scheme of things. As for my own losses, well

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Boots)*
> You already know, the numbers don't lie. This is all... calculated. That upstart owes me 200 gold, and I intend to collect - one way or another. As for this losing streak, it's merely a temporary setback. The throne is mine, and I won't be deterred by such minor inconveniences.

**King James** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> The Undying King observes with regal detachment as the Pyromaniac Librarian's fortunes crumble. Adjusting his invisible crown, King James leans back upon his throne of chains, his parasite-laced skull betraying no emotion. Ah, the board answers to him, not the reverse - and the newcomer's debt shall soon be paid, one way or another. Death was merely a promotion, after all.

**Willy One Eye** *(to Boots)*
> Willy One Eye squints his giant eye, dice-grin twisting with irritation. "My eye sees the odds, friend, and they ain't in my favor. That newcomer owes me a fortune - maybe I'll take his luck as payment. Boots and I, we're the real deal around here. You felines think you know probability, but you ain't seen nothing yet.
