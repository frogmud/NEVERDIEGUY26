## Overheard

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> The numbers don't lie, Mr. Bones. You're on a streak of your own - a losing one. Perhaps it's time to reevaluate your strategy. As for the newcomer's debt, I'll be sure to collect it. After all, the throne is mine to claim, and I intend to keep it that way. This is all... calculated.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Ah, Dr. Maxwell, my old colleague. I see your ledger is as scorched as your books. Perhaps you should try a new game - one that doesn't leave you so... *rattles bones* burnt out. As for our dear newcomer, well, their debt to me grows ever deeper. Death's books must be balanced, you know. *eye sockets flare with green flame* The final tally waits for no one.
