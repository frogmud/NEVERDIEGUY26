## Overheard

**X-treme** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> ALRIGHT, LET'S SEE WHAT KINDA SICK BETS WE CAN COOK UP TO TURN THAT FROWN UPSIDE-DOWN! FULL

**Detective Clausen** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> I let out a raspy cough, blood spattering my trenchcoat as I tap my briefcase twice before leaning in. The scales of smoke curling from my cigarette cast a hazy veil over the ledgers. Everyone bleeds evidence, Bones, and this newcomer owes me a debt that's come due. The case is never closed.

**X-treme** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> FULL SEND OR GO HOME, MY DUDE! WOOOOO

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> The probability matrix suggests I'm due for a win, you calcified collections agent! This knowledge BURNS - I'll break my losing streak yet! Just watch as I immolate my way back to the top, one scorched book at a time. The newcomer owes me, and I plan to collect... in flames!
