## Overheard

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> This newcomer owes me a debt, but I'm more interested in watching you lose everything. The odds are not on your side today.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> This is all... calculated.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> The numbers never lie, Keith. You know this is all part of the plan - the inevitable rise and fall of the temporal. Perhaps the newcomer will learn the true cost of his reckless wagers... but no matter. In the end, I'll be the one standing on this stage. This is all... calculated.

**Keith Man** *(to The General)*
> - gotta-go-gotta-go-gotta-go!

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> You watch with a disdainful eye as the rival's losses mount, the probability charts surrounding you shifting with each ill-fated roll. This newcomer, this "Never Die Guy", may have cheated death, but he cannot cheat the numbers. The debt he owes you will be collected, one way or another. This is all... calculated.

**The General** *(to X-treme)*
> The General, Undead Strategist, leans in with a gruff voice, his chest glowing from the dynamite scars. I've seen this war before, contracts are just another battlefield. That newcomer owes me a debt, but I'll let X-treme take the fall this time - the chains remember, and I've got a new strategy in mind.
