## Overheard

**The General** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Shall we compare notes? Perhaps we can find a way to break this stalemate.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> I grind my teeth, the stitches in my jaw creaking as I glare at the merchant. Damn this cursed immortality - I've stitched a thousand wounds, but the ones that haunt me never heal. That newcomer owes me a fortune, and I'll be damned if I let him skip out on his tab again. Another loss, another tally in the book. I need a drink...or five.

**Boo G** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> Yo yo YO! Boo G, the Spectral MC, spittin' rhymes in the shadows! This newcomer owes me some mad gold, ya dig? But don't worry, Mr. Bones, I'ma let this rival lose it all - the beat of the dice is my favorite rhythm! That's how I keep my GHOSTLY flow going, am I right? Let it ride, let it ride, baby! *beatboxes a sick beat*

**Boo G** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Yo yo YO, Detective Clausen! Boo G, Spectral MC, here to lay down some GHOSTLY beats. That newcomer, Never Die Guy, owes me 225 gold - let it ride, let it ride! But hey, ain't no thang, we all gotta roll the dice sometimes. *beatboxes a haunting rhythm* That beat was GHOSTLY, my friend. Now, what's got you so tilted, huh? Lay it on me, I'm all ears!
