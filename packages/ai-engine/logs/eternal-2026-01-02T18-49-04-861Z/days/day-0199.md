## Overheard

**Mr. Bones** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> Willy One Eye, my old friend - or should I say, my old debt collector. I see you've been keeping busy trying to recoup those losses. Ah, but I've a bone to pick with you - this newcomer, this 'Never Die Guy', owes me a pretty penny. Perhaps we could... come to an arrangement, hmm? After all, death is just a transaction, and his account is most certainly overdue.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> But then again, the winds

**Dr. Voss** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> Your survival instincts remain honed, I see. I'll be sure to
