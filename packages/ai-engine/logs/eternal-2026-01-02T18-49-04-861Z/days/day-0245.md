## Overheard

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> You know, Keith, the numbers don't lie - my win streak may be short, but the path forward is clear. That newcomer may owe me a pretty penny, but I'll be the one collecting when I'm through with you. This is all... calculated.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> This is all... calculated.

**Keith Man** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> 475 gold, right?

**King James** *(to The General)*
> The King glances towards the newcomer, a hint of amusement in his regal demeanor. "Ah, General, our wayward guest still owes me a small fortune, does he not? Fret not, my old friend - the board answers to me, and our luck shall turn, as it always does." He adjusts the invisible crown upon his head, the chains behind his throne shifting with an unseen power.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> I'm an open book... that is, until it burns to ash!

**Dr. Voss** *(to King James)*
> glances sidelong at King

**Detective Clausen** *(to The General)*
> The case is never closed, General. Seems like the newcomer's not the only one who's down on their luck. Maybe you should try something a little...unorthodox. Smoke doesn't lie - you're both just one bad roll away from being back in the game.
