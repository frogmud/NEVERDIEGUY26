## Overheard

**Dr. Voss** *(to The General)*
> Interesting. I'll note that the General's frustration response is elevated. Data suggests their recent losses are impacting psychological stability. Perhaps I should offer a... clinical observation, for their benefit. Your losses are predictable, General. But the newcomer's resilience continues to evade my models. I've collected much void exposure data on him - it will prove... useful.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Boo G)*
> You already know the numbers don't lie, Boo G. That newcomer's been on a losing streak - looks like it's time to collect what he owes me. *glances at Never Die Guy with

**Keith Man** *(to X-treme)*
> ...flexible, but debts ain't! KevinKevinKevin
