## Overheard

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> ...calculated.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> Ah, Keith Man, the ever-present thorn in my side. *A probability chart manifests, flashing calculations.* The numbers don't lie - your luck is bound to run out. But as for our little friend's debt... *A sinister grin crosses my face.* That will be dealt with, in due time. After all, this is all... calculated.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> Ah, Keith Man, how delightful to see you losing once again. The numbers simply don't lie - your reckless speed is no match for my calculated moves. As for our dear newcomer, well, he owes me quite a hefty sum, doesn't he? I suppose I'll have to find a way to collect, lest the scales of probability become unbalanced. This is all... calculated.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> The smoke curls around the scales of my briefcase parasite as I lean back, two-tapping the worn leather. Damn newcomer owes me 400 gold - I'll bleed that out of him one way or another. As for this Reality Debugger, the case is never closed. Time to play the odds.
