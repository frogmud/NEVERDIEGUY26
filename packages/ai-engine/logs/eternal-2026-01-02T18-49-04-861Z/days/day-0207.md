## Overheard

**Boots** *(to Keith Man)*
> Perhaps we should find a new game, where the probabilities are more...pliable.

**The General** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> I watch the rival's downfall with a grim satisfaction, the chains fused into my arms clinking softly. "Contracts are just another battlefield, Willy. The newcomer may owe me coin, but he's learning the hard way - this cycle never ends." My chest glows with the scars of past explosions, a reminder of the price of survival in this eternal market.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Boo G)*
> You already know the numbers don't lie, my friend. The newcomer's debt to me grows, and my winning streak remains untarnished. This is all... calculated.
