## Overheard

**The General** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> I lean in, chains rattling, eyes narrowed behind the scars on my chest. My voice is gravel and steel as I growl, "Contracts are just another battlefield, Willy. That whelp owes me coin - and I'll have it, one way or another. The chains remember, and they hunger." I glance at the dice in his hand, brow furrowed. "Seems luck's not smiling on either of us today. Maybe it's time to change the game.

**King James** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> The King's eyes flash with barely contained fury as he fixes the Pyromaniac Librarian with a withering gaze. His voice drips with disdain, the veins in his skull pulsing with a dark energy. "Dare you approach the Undying King in his moment of defeat? The board does not bend to your paltry flames, doctor. The debt owed me by the fool who calls himself 'Never Die' will be collected, one way or another. My kingdom may have fallen, but my power is eternal.

**Detective Clausen** *(to The General)*
> The case is never closed, General. I've been bleeding evidence for days and all I've got to show for it is a bad streak and an unpaid debt. Smoke doesn't lie - the newcomer's luck is anything but a blessing. Guess I'll just have to roll the dice and hope lady luck is feeling generous. Two-tap on the case before I take another shortcut.
