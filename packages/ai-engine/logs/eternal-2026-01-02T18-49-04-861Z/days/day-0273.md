## Overheard

**Detective Clausen** *(to King James)*
> The smoke curls around my fingers as I tap the worn case, the scales shifting in the air like an omen. The game never ends, King James - it just changes players. This newcomer owes me, and I aim to collect, one way or another. Everyone bleeds evidence, and I'll pry the truth from him if I have to.

**King James** *(to Keith Man)*
> The Undying King's words resound with an air of regal disdain, the parasite veins upon his skull pulsing with each syllable. 'The newcomer's debt matters not, for the board answers to me and me alone. Death was merely a promotion

**Boo G** *(to X-treme)*
> Yo yo YO, X-treme my dude! That was a GHOSTLY drop, am I right? Hah, poor Never Die Guy, always bouncing back from the brink. Guess he owes me a few more bars after that one, am I right? Let it ride, let it ride - the beat goes on, ya dig? That beat was GHOSTLY, though, I gotta say. Now, whatchu got for me, my spectral brother? Time to spin that wheel and see what the flow has in store!
