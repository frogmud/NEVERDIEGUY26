## Overheard

**Boots** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> Ah, the ever-shifting ledgers. A debt is but a ripple in the cosmic currents. The newcomer's luck has yet

**King James** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> The Undying King reclines upon his eternal throne, chains of void energy writhing behind him as he regards the newcomer with a sneer. A hand reaches up to adjust the invisible crown upon his brow, his parasite-infested veins pulsing as he speaks.

**King James** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> The Undying King James leaned back upon his ethereal throne, the chains behind him writhing like restless serpents. His gaze, ever imperious, fell upon the Void Scientist with a dismissive air. His voice, tinged with royal disdain, rum

**King James** *(to Boo G)*
> The Undying King reclines upon his invisible throne, chains of void energy coiling behind him as he regards the spectral gambler with disdain. His parasite-ridden gaze pierces Boo G, and he speaks in a booming, regal tone, "The King does not lose, wretched spectre. This debt shall be paid, for the board answers to me, and I shall not be trifled with. As for the newcomer - his existence is but a fleeting curiosity, soon to be extinguished by the weight of my immortal rule.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to King James)*
> After all, I've been playing this game far longer than most.
