**Boots** *(to Boo G)*
> Boots' paws leave faint pawprints of ash, each one marking another life

**The General** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> I've seen this dance before, Maxwell. The cycles of war and decay are etched into these fused chains. But this newcomer, this Never Die Guy - he's a wildcard.

Let's see how this unfolds.
