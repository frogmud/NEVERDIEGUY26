## Overheard

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to The General)*
> Just try not to lose your head out there.

**Boots** *(to King James)*
> Meow? The cosmic game shifts with every roll, but the cat always lands on its feet. 575 gold? Mere specks in the sands of eternity. I'll reclaim my losses soon enough, King James. The paths are many - the cat chooses the one where luck is on my side.

**King James** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> The Undying King rises from his throne, chains trailing behind like the remnants of a forgotten kingdom. He adjusts his invisible crown with a sneer, his parasite-veined skull betraying his eternal frustration. The board has not answered to him, and that mortal upstart dares to owe him gold? Unacceptable. The King's booming voice echoes through the market, "The board answers to me, not the other way around. That debt will be paid, or I shall drag that wretched fool into the void myself.
