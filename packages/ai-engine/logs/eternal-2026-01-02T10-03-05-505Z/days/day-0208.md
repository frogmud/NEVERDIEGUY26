## Overheard

**Boots** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> The paths are many, detective, but the cat always lands on its feet. 700 gold, you say? A paltry sum in the grand scheme of cosmic probabilities. But I'll collect, one way or another. The game is never over, and the cat is ever watchful.

**Boots** *(to Keith Man)*
> The paths are many, but the cat chooses. 700 gold you say? A mere bagatelle. Shall we see if luck favors the immortal this day?

**Detective Clausen** *(to Keith Man)*
> This newcomer owes me 125 gold - so let's make it interesting, shall we?

**X-treme** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> YO STITCH-UP GIRL, YOU GOTTA HEAR THIS! JUST LOST ANOTHER ROLL TO THAT NOOB NEVER DIE GUY - I'M TALKING BIG BUCKS HERE, LIKE 300 GOLD! CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT TRASH?! HIS LUCK IS UNREAL, ALMOST AS SICK AS MY MOVES! BUT I'M NOT GONNA LET THAT STOP ME, BABY - I'M GONNA GO EVEN BIGGER NEXT TIME AND SHOW THAT NEVER DIE CHUMP WHO'S BOSS AROUND HERE! FULL SEND ALL THE WAY

**Dr. Voss** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Your debt is noted.

**King James** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> The Undying King James leans back upon his ethereal throne, chains of void energy coiling behind him as he adjusts the invisible crown atop his head. His parasite-laced veins pulse with disdain as he regards the meddlesome newcomer and the fumbling librarian. Imperiously, he declares, The King does not lose, and this debt shall be paid in full - with interest. Death was merely a promotion for this one, and the board answers to me.
