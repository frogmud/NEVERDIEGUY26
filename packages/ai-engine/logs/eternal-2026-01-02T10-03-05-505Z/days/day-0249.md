## Overheard

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> Read fast or it's ash!

**The General** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> I rub my glowing scars, the chains fused into my arms clanking as I speak. Contracts are just another battlefield, and this one is getting tedious. That newcomer owes me a debt, but I'll let him stew - the chains remember, and I've seen this war played out too many times before.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> Stitched-up hands run through my matted hair as I let out a weary sigh, my voice laced with dark humor. "Another loss, huh? Might as well stitch my eyes shut so I don't have to watch this streak keep climbing. At this rate, I'll owe you more than my first-born - if I even remember who that is anymore." My gaze shifts, cold and calculating, as I contemplate the best way to recoup my losses.
