## Overheard

**Detective Clausen** *(to Boots)*
> Smoke doesn't lie, and everyone bleeds something. Let's see if we can't bleed the truth out of this one.

**Dr. Voss** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> Data doesn't lie, Mr. Bones. The newcomer's debt to me is a statistical anomaly that must be resolved. I'll note your... heated state, but emotions are irrelevant when the numbers don't add up. Shall we proceed with our exchange, or would you prefer to... cool off first? I have more void exposure data to collect.

**Boots** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Perhaps it's time to see if the fickle winds of fate blow in my favor once more. The newcomer's debt lingers, but my paws have a mind of their own. Meow?

**Dr. Voss** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Data shows your record is... lackluster, Mr. Kevin. Perhaps you should try a different approach. I'll note this interaction for my void exposure study. Now, about that gold the newcomer owes me - I'd like to collect before the odds shift again.

**The General** *(to Boo G)*
> Time to even the score.
