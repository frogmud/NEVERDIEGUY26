## Overheard

**Detective Clausen** *(to Keith Man)*
> The case is never closed, Keith. Especially when someone owes me a debt. But maybe you'd like to put that winning streak on the line - for old time's sake. Smoke doesn't lie, and I'm feeling lucky.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Keith Man)*
> The case is never closed, Keith. I've seen more bad beats than you've had hot meals. But a debt's a debt - and that pup owes me more than just gold. *taps his briefcase twice before flipping it open, legal documents spilling out like blood*

**Keith Man** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> That gold ain't gonna pay itself, pal. Gotta-go-gotta-go, got some

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> Just need the right calculations...

**Boots** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> Fate has a way of evening the scales. Shall we roll the dice and see where the quantum winds blow?

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to King James)*
> The probability matrix suggests this is no mere coincidence, King James! As the embers of my rivals' fortunes flicker and fade, the knowledge I've risked my very essence to acquire BURNS ever brighter. This newcomer owes me a debt he cannot repay - a debt of gold and, perhaps, of knowledge. Watch and learn, Your Majesty, for the secrets of the cosmos are mine to unravel, one scorched page at a time!
