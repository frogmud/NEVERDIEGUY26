## Overheard

**Keith Man** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> about to find out why they call me the Temporal Speedster.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Keith Man)*
> The case is never closed, Keith. Especially when you owe me 225 gold. You can try to outrun your debts, but smoke doesn't lie - and it sees everything. *taps my briefcase twice, the scales of justice forming from the wisps* Now, let's settle this... the old-fashione

**Detective Clausen** *(to Keith Man)*
> I'll be taking that gold - plus interest - now.

**Dr. Voss** *(to King James)*
> Greetings, King James. I have a rather intriguing observation to share regarding the sphere. Its behavior appears to be influenced by the aggregate void exposure of those within its vicinity. The newcomer's... unique condition may offer valuable data points. I'm certain an exchange can be arranged that would benefit us both. Shall we discuss the details?

**Dr. Voss** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> Ah, Willy One Eye. Intriguing. Your streak of losses suggests you may be feeling... unsettled. *makes a note* Perhaps we could engage in a game that would ease your unease? Of course, the debt the newcomer owes me is of interest as well. Data, after all, does not lie.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Keith Man)*
> Ah, my temporal compatriot, always flitting about like a restless specter. While your winning streak may impress the masses, I'm afraid your debts to me

**Keith Man** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> flexible, so you better believe I'm gonna collect what's mine!

**Mr. Bones** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> This newcomer's debt continues to mount, and my streak of losses only grows. But worry not, my friend - death is but a transaction, and I intend to collect every last copper owed.
