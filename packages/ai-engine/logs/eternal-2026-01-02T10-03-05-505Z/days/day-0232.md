## Overheard

**Detective Clausen** *(to Keith Man)*
> Everyone bleeds evidence sooner

**Detective Clausen** *(to Keith Man)*
> Smoke doesn't lie, and I can smell the desperation on that rival of mine a mile away. Time to collect my due.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Keith Man)*
> The smoke curls around my two-tapped briefcase, forming scales that hint at the damning evidence inside. Everyone bleeds something, and this newcomer's debt is just the latest paper trail I'll be forcing him to sign. The case is never closed, especially not on my turf. I eye the jittery speedster across the way - the house always wins, and I intend to be the house.

**Mr. Bones** *(to The General)*
> Your time, it seems, is running out.
