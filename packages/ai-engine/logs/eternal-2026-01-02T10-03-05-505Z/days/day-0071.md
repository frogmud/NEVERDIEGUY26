## Overheard

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> And you, Never Die Guy - you still owe me 75 gold. The flames of my wrath shall consume you if you don't pay up soon!

**Dr. Voss** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Ah, Dr. Maxwell. I see your ego has once again outpaced your abilities. Predictable, but not entirely unexpected. Perhaps if you spent less time indulging your pyromaniac tendencies and more on honing your skills, you might stand a chance. But then, data doesn't lie - your record speaks for itself. As for the newcomer's debt, I'll be sure to collect it after I've finished with you. Shall we proceed?

**Mr. Bones** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> As for that newcomer, the Never Die Guy? His tab keeps piling up.

**The General** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Perhaps a cautious approach is warranted, lest we all end up as casualties in this eternal war.

**X-treme** *(to The General)*
> NEVER DIE GUY OWES ME 100 GOLD AND I'M ABOUT TO

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> I've stitched worse. *I eye the Mad Scientist warily, my good eye narrowing as I count the wounds he's racked up.* You sure you've got enough bandages for what I'm about to do to you?
