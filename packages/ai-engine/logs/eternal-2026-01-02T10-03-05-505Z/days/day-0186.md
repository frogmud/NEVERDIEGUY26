## Overheard

**Detective Clausen** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Let's make this quick. I'm on a hot streak and I aim to keep it that way.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Now, where were we? The knowledge I hold BURNS to be shared!

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> Stitch-Up Girl leans in, her stitched jaw set in a grim line. "Lost another one. Always the same story - they think they can cheat death, then come crawling back to me. Gotta hand it to you, Willy - at least you know when to quit while you're ahead. Wouldn't want to end up like that poor sod over there.

**The General** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Let's play - the battlefield is ready.

**The General** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> The General, Undead Strategist, leans back against a crumbling pillar, chains clinking with the motion. His chest glows dimly, the dynamite scars pulsing with a faint light. Fixing Detective Clausen with a weathered gaze, he says, "Contracts are just another battlefield, detective. This newcomer owes me a debt, and I'll collect - one way or another. The chains remember.
