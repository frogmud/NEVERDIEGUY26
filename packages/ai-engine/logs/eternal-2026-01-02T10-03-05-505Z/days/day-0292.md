## Overheard

**Detective Clausen** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> The case is never closed, Stitch-Up. That newcomer owes me 125 gold, and I'm down 4 on the Ceelo board. But the smoke never lies - I'll bleed the truth out of him, one way or another. Everyone bleeds evidence, and I always get my due.

**Willy One Eye** *(to King James)*
> Seven come eleven, King James. The odds have not been kind to me of late, but my eye never lies. That newcomer owes me a pretty penny - perhaps we could make a wager that would settle his debt? I see the colors of probability swirling, and the time is ripe for a game of chance.

**Willy One Eye** *(to King James)*
> Seven come eleven, King James. The odds are not in my favor today, but I see the threads of probability unraveling. That newcomer owes me a pretty penny - if he wants to keep breathing, he'd best pay up. Now, what can this old Cyclops do for you, hmm? My eye never lies.

**King James** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> The Undying King, James, reclines upon his ethereal throne, chains from the void coiling behind him. He regards the Stitch-Up Girl with a regal disdain, the parasitic veins upon his skull pulsing. "The board answers to me, child. The mortal's debt shall be paid, whether by his own hand or at mine own leisure. Death was merely a promotion for one such as I.
