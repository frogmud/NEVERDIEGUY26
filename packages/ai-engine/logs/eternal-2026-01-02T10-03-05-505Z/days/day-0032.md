## Overheard

**The General** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> I meet Mr. Bones' scorching gaze, the chains fused to my arms clinking as I lean forward. My chest glows with the scars of past explosions, a constant reminder of the costs of war. 

My weathered voice is laced with the patience of a Civil War veteran as I reply, "The contracts may have changed, but the battlefield remains the same. I've seen this cycle before - the newcomer owes a debt, and I

**Detective Clausen** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> The case is never closed, Mr. Bones. But your hot streak ends today. I'm about to bleed the truth from you, one tally mark at a time. Smoke doesn't lie - and neither do the scales of justice I carry in these files. *taps briefcase twice before opening it*

He fixes the detective with a steady gaze, the flicker of dynamite scars casting an eerie light across his face.

> The past has a way of catching up to us all. Now, what game shall we play? I grow restless.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> You know, Mr. Bones, the numbers never lie. I've been calculating the probabilities, and it seems our dear newcomer's luck is starting to catch

**Willy One Eye** *(to Boo G)*
> Looks like they owe me a hundred more after this little mishap. But hey, that's the game, ain't it? The House always wins - or at least, this House does.
