**Willy One Eye** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> This immortal's streak is about to begin anew.

**Boo G** *(to Boots)*
> Yo yo YO, Boots! That beat you just dropped was cold as ICE, yo. But I ain't here to talk about your wack records - this newcomer's been hoggin' all the good beats, and I'm TIRED of it! He owes me 650 gold and I ain't lettin' him slide - that's my flow, my rhythm, my PROBABILITY, ya dig?
