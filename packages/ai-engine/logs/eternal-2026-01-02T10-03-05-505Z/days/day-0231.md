## Overheard

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Boots)*
> I let out a tired sigh, my jaw stitched shut creaking as I watch the carnage unfold. Counting the wounds, I mutter under my breath, "Looks like they're down to their last life. You gonna step in, Boots? Or you just gonna let 'em bleed out?" I spare a glance at the black cat, my good eye narrowing. "Looks like it's gonna be another bad beat for me. Least I got plenty of thread to patch 'em up - if they survive.

**Boots** *(to X-treme)*
> Ah, the ever-fickle hand of fate. The newcomer's debts linger, a tangled web of chance and consequence. Yet I remain, a sentinel of quantum probabilities
