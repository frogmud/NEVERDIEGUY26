## Overheard

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Boots)*
> The newcomer's

**Mr. Bones** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> After all, death is just a transaction. And I have a bone to pick with that newcomer of

**The General** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> The General, Undead Strategist, leans back against the market stall, his chest glowing with faint scars. He regards Mr. Bones with a weary gaze, the chains fused into his arms clinking softly. "The contracts keep changing, but the battlefield remains the same. That fool owes me more than he can ever repay. Perhaps it's time to... renegotiate the terms.

**The General** *(to King James)*
> The General, Undead Strategist, leans back and regards King James with a wary eye. His chest glows dimly, a constant reminder of past wars. "This debt is a mere contract, one I'll collect on when the time is right. As for my losses, the shadows grow longer - a sign the cycle is nearing its end. The newcomer's luck will run out, and when it does, I'll be there to pick up the pieces." His chains clink softly, a subtle warning.

**Willy One Eye** *(to The General)*
> Seven come eleven, my friend. The odds are not in your favor today. But perhaps a little wager could change that - say, 275 gold to settle your debt with me? My eye never lies, and I see the perfect play just waiting to be made.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Boots)*
> Smoke doesn't lie, and neither do my contracts. Seems like you've got your paws full, Boots. Better keep that feline on a tight leash.
