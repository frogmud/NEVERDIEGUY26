## Overheard

**King James** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> The Undying King leans back in his throne, a faint smile playing across his lips as he watches the rival before him lose everything. He adjusts the invisible crown upon his head, the chains behind his throne rattling with the movement. "The board answers to me, fool. Death was merely a promotion, and this mortal's debt shall be paid in full." His parasite-infested veins pulse with dark energy as he surveys the scene, his gaze unreadable.
