## Overheard

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> choice volumes that may pique your interest. Read fast or it's all gone up in flames!

**Boots** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> 575 gold is no small debt, detective. Shall we roll the dice and see where fate leads us?

**Detective Clausen** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> raps his knuckles twice on the worn leather of his briefcase before pocketing a small contract

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to King James)*
> I'll stitch you up, Your Majesty, if you'll just hold still. Though the way my luck's been going, I might just make it worse. *lets out a tired sigh* Remind me again why I keep coming back to this hellscape? *glances around warily, hand drifting to the parasite-threads at her side*

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> The probability matrix suggests, my dear detective, that the knowledge I possess burns brighter with each passing century! *flicks a match, watching the flames dance* Ah, the old days - when the tomes of forbidden lore would singe my very fingertips with their secrets. *mutters under breath* Such fleeting moments of discovery, before the pages turn to ash. *glances at newcomer, grinning wickedly* As for our young friend's debt - I'll collect it, in due time. The thirst for knowledge is a cruel mistress indeed.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> You already know the numbers, Bones. The newcomer's debt keeps rising, and my streak grows ever more precarious. But the game is far from over

**Boo G** *(to King James)*
> Yo yo YO! This newcomer, Never Die Guy, is really KILLIN' me, you feel me? I'm down 325 GOLD and my Ceelo record is STRAIGHT GARBAGE. Gotta get this GHOSTLY FLOW back on track, ya dig? Let it ride, let it ride - I'm feelin' that rhythm, King James, but this beat ain't workin' for me right now. That beat was GHOSTLY, but it ain't hittin' the same, know what I'm sayin'?
