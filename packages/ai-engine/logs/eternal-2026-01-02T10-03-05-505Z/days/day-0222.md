## The Newcomer
> died on ante 1, rescued by Keith Man

## Overheard

**Detective Clausen** *(to Boots)*
> The case is never closed, Cosmic Cat. That newcomer still owes me 125 gold - and I'm on a winning streak. Let's see if we can't bleed out the truth from your crypt

**Detective Clausen** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Everyone bleeds

**Mr. Bones** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> Your record seems a touch... underdeveloped, my dear. Perhaps you should consider a new line of work - one that doesn't involve constantly ending up on my books. As for our dear newcomer, well, their account is certainly... overdue. I suspect they'll be back again soon enough. Death, after all, is just a transaction.
