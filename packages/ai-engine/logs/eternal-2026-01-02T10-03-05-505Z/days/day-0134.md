## Overheard

**Detective Clausen** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> The case is never closed, Doc. And this newcomer - he's racking up a debt faster than I can keep track. *two-taps the worn briefcase at my side* But you and I, we've been playing this game for centuries. Time to add another tally to the win column, don't you think? Smoke doesn't lie.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Two-tap on the case before I get to the point, Doc. This streak of yours is looking a little too hot - just like those books of yours. But I'll let you know when the tables turn. Oh, and that whelp owes me 125 gold - you wouldn't happen to have a line on where he's hiding, would you?

**Boo G** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Yo yo YO, Dr. Maaaxwell! That beat just won't drop for Boo G, ya dig? This Never Die guy is KILLIN' me with these bad beats - 325 gold he owes me, and I'm on a COLD streak. But you know I'm always ready to let it ride, let it ride! Throw me somethin' hot, Doc, these ghostly notes ain't makin' the cut. GHOSTLY, I tell ya!

**X-treme** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> YOOOO WILLY! THAT LAST ROUND WAS SICK, AM I RIGHT?! Ahh, I shoulda known better than to bet EVERYTHING on a single roll, but the RUSH, bro! The RUSH! Ugh, now I'm down big to the new guy. But you know what they say - GOTTA RISK IT TO GET THE BISCUIT! Let's get back in there and turn this thing around, FULL SEND style! WOOOOO!

**Detective Clausen** *(to X-treme)*
