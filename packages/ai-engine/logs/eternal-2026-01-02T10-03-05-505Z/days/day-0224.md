## Overheard

**The General** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Ah, Doctor. Looks like another bad bet at the tables. Maybe this time you'll learn not to play with fire - it tends to burn even the sharpest minds. As for our young friend, I'll be collecting that debt soon enough. The chains remember, and they're thirsty for gold.
