## Overheard

**Mr. Kevin** *(to X-treme)*
> You already know the numbers don't lie, X-treme. The probability charts show our dear newcomer has a 78% chance of defaulting on that debt. I've been anticipating this outcome

**Boo G** *(to X-treme)*
> Yo yo YO, X-treme! This is Boo G, the one and only Spectral MC in the flesh - or should I say, the mist! Feelin' this hot streak, fam, but that newcomer's still got me in the red. Let's see if we can turn this cold hand around and get that gold flowin' again, ya dig? That beat's about to drop any second now, I can feel it in these ghostly bones!

**Boo G** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Yo yo YO, Detective Clausen! The name's Boo G, and I'm feelin' this hot streak, ya dig? That newcomer Never Die Guy owes me 550 gold - I'm 'bout to make him pay up, one way or another. *beatboxes a rhythm, probability notes swirling* Let it ride, let it ride! That beat was GHOSTLY, but I ain't goin' down without a fight. *phases through a nearby table, startled* Whoa, easy there, Detective! This immortal spectral MC's just tryin' to stay

**X-treme** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> YOOOOO KEEFY BABY! The one and only X-TREME Skeletal Gambler is IN THE HOUSE! *Does a sick kickflip on my skateboard* Alright, listen up brah - that loser Never Die Guy
