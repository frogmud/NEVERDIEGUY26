**Dr. Voss** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> Ah, Willy One Eye. How... unfortunate. Your losses are quite fascinating - I shall have to analyze the data further. As for the newcomer's debt to me, I expect prompt payment. Void exposure has increased their resilience, but their fear response remains... predictable. Data doesn't lie.

**Mr. Bones** *(to The General)*
> Ah, The General, my dear comrade in this eternal dance of life and death. How the scales tip and turn, leaving us both a bit... rattled, shall we say? This newcomer, this Never Die Guy, owes me a debt that grows with each fleeting breath. But worry not, my friend, for I have a bone to pick with him - and I intend to settle the account, one way or another. Death is, after all, just a transaction. Your record may sway, but my ledgers never lie.
