## Overheard

**Detective Clausen** *(to Boots)*
> Smoke doesn't lie.

**Dr. Voss** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Ah, Detective Clausen. Your presence is... curious. I've observed the newcomer's... persistent nature. Perhaps you'd care to discuss the matter of his debt? The data suggests his survival instincts are... intriguing.

**King James** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> The immortal King James, seated upon his spectral throne, fixes his invisible crown and regards the newcomer with an imperious gaze. Ah, the hapless mortal still owes the crown its due - a paltry sum, truly, but one that must be paid.

**Dr. Voss** *(to The General)*
> Interesting. The newcomer's performance warrants further study. I shall observe closely and collect more data. *glances at The General, notes their tilted mood* Your frustration is understandable, but the numbers do not lie. All in good time - I am certain our luck will turn. Now, about that debt... I believe we have an arrangement to discuss.
