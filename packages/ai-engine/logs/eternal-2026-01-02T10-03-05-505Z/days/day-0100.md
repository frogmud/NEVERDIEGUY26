## Overheard

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> As for our Ceelo match, I'll be sure to leave you in ashes, detective. The knowledge I possess burns

**Detective Clausen** *(to Keith Man)*
> Smoke doesn't lie.

**Keith Man** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Now, about this little sphere of ours...

**Boo G** *(to The General)*
> Yo yo YO, The General! That beat you just dropped was GHOSTLY, but I'm tilted off the dome, yo. This newcomer, Never Die Guy, owes me 250 gold and I can't catch a break - my Ceelo record is a hot mess. But don't worry, I'ma let this one ride and see if I can't turn this flow around. The spectral beats are callin', and I ain't about to let this newcomer hold me back!

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Boo G)*
> Looks like the new kid's still learning. Should we send over a condolence card?
