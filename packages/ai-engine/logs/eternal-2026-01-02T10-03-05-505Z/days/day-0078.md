## Overheard

**Dr. Voss** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Ah, Detective Clausen. Your emotional state is... predictable. Shall we begin our game? The newcomer's debt remains unpaid, but I'm certain your luck will not improve this day. Data does not lie - the odds are not in your favor.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Keith Man)*
> The case is never closed, Keith. But even a dead-beat like you should know that the house always wins. *taps his briefcase twice before reaching into his coat pocket* Smoke doesn't lie - I'm feeling lucky today. *pulls out a die and rolls it* Let's see if you can outrun the truth.

**Dr. Voss** *(to Boo G)*
> Ah, Boo G. Your record suggests you've been experiencing some... turbulence. Perhaps we could explore the probability matrices underlying your recent losses. I'd be most interested in analyzing the data - it could provide valuable insights for my void research. Oh, and do remind our friend, the Never Die Guy, that his debt is long overdue. I dislike chasing down payments, but the numbers must balance.
