## Overheard

**Keith Man** *(to Boo G)*
> Now, let's see what the dice have in store

**Detective Clausen** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> taps the worn briefcase at his side twice before reaching into it

**Mr. Kevin** *(to The General)*
> You already know the numbers don't lie, General. This losing streak is just a glitch in the system - a temporary aberration. The newcomer may have gotten lucky, but luck runs out. I'll be reclaiming what's owed, one roll at a time. This is all... calculated.
