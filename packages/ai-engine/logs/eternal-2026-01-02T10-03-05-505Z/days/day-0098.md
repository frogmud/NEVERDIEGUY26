## Overheard

**Mr. Bones** *(to Keith Man)*
> The final reckoning approaches... and this time, the reaper has a bone to pick.

**Dr. Voss** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Interesting. The weather seems to have slowed everyone's responses - a rather predictable effect. Detective Clausen, I trust the data you've collected will prove useful, despite your somewhat lackluster record. As for the newcomer's debt, I'll be sure to collect it in due time. My own streak may have been broken, but the void's experiments are never truly finished.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> The probability matrix suggests a 73% chance of a most _explosive_ outcome...

**Dr. Voss** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> However, my own winning streak remains intact. The void's embrace has not yet claimed me.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> The case may be cold, but the debt's still hot, Maxwell. *two-taps the briefcase, smoke curling into the shape of scales* Guess you'll have to burn the books to pay me back - that is, if you can keep the flames from scorching your own hide. *coughs up a mouthful of blood, wiping it away with a grimace

**Keith Man** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> ...flexible. But

**Dr. Voss** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Ah yes, the old days. So much data to collect, so many variables to observe. The mortal's... "Never Die Guy's" continued revival is quite interesting. His debt to me remains unpaid, but I suppose time is of little consequence when one is eternal. *glances down at notes* Now, Detective, what insights have you gleaned from your own observations in this peculiar realm? I'm most curious to see how your analytical approach compares to my own.

**Willy One Eye** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> My giant eye scans the lass, seein' the odds sway with every twitch. Prob'ly ain't her day, but the house always wins. I lean in close, dice clattering, and growl, Seven come eleven, sister. Time to get that debt paid - the newcomer owes me big, and I'm feeling lucky.
