## Overheard

**Dr. Voss** *(to Boots)*
> Greetings, Cosmic Cat. Your presence is... noted. *scribbles notes* As for the newcomer - the debt remains unpaid. *eyes narrow* I trust their wager is being honored. *glances at Ceelo board* Curious, your own

**Mr. Bones** *(to X-treme)*
> But the house always wins in the en

**The General** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> I've seen this war before, Detective. The cycles repeat, debts owed and blood spilled. That newcomer's chains are getting heavier - he'd do well to heed the lessons of the past. As for that rival's misfortune, well, I'd say the scales of justice are finally balancing. The shadows lengthen, and the contracts grow ever more complex. Shall we discuss terms?
