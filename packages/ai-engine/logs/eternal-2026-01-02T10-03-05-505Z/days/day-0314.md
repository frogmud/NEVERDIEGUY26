## Overheard

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Boots)*
> Guess that makes 125 gold they owe me now, huh, Boots?

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Boots)*
> leans back,

**Boo G** *(to Keith Man)*
> Yo yo YO, Keith Man! You see this beat? Ghostly as hell, am I right? Nah nah, don't even try to flex on me with that record - I'm about to even the odds, just you wait! That Never Die Guy owes me 650 gold, and I'm gonna collect every last note, you feel me? Gotta keep this flow going, let it ride, let it ride!

**Detective Clausen** *(to Boo G)*
> The case is never closed, Boo G. And it looks like your luck has been running a little cold lately. Maybe it's time for a change of tune - one that's a little more in tune with the odds. As for the rookie, he's got a debt to pay. And I plan to collect, one way or another. The truth has a way of bleeding out, whether you like it or not.
