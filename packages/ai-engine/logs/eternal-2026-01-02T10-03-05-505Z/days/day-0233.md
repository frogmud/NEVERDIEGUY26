**King James** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> The Undying King leaned back upon his ethereal throne, the chains of the void coiling behind him as he adjusted the invisible crown upon his brow. "Ah, Stitch-Up Girl, it appears the fickle wheel of fortune has turned against you once more. Perchance the newcomer might repay his debt to me, and I could deign to assist you - though the King's largesse is not to be taken for granted.

**Willy One Eye** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> Seven come eleven, friend. The odds don't lie - my eye sees the newcomer's debt as a lucky roll just waiting to happen. But I'll sweeten the pot - how about we make it a double-or-nothing on the next throw? The house always wins, as they say.
