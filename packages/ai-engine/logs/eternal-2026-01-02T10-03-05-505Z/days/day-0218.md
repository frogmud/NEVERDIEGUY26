## Overheard

**Mr. Bones** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> Death is just a transaction, my friend. And I aim to settle the books.

**The General** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> I've seen more wars than I can count, Doc, and this one's no different. That newcomer owes me a fortune, but the chains remember - I'll collect what's mine, one way or another. Contracts are just another battlefield, and I aim to come out on top, even if it means getting my hands a little dirty.

**Willy One Eye** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> You think I'm tilted, do ya, doc? Heh, my eye never lies - the odds are stacked against me, but I'll turn this streak around yet. That Never Die fella owes me a pretty penny, and I aim to collect. Now, what've you got that could help a poor cyclops catch a lucky break?
