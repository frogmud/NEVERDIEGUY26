## Overheard

**Detective Clausen** *(to Keith Man)*
> Smoke doesn't lie - this streak ends here

**Keith Man** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Gotta-go-gotta-go-

**X-treme** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> WHAT'S UP DOC? RIGGED THAT LAST ROUND OF CEE-LO, DIDN'T YA? GOTTA BE CAREFUL, THE X-TREME GAMBLER

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Keith Man)*
> "Guess that's one more I won't have to worry about stitching up. Karma's a bitch, ain't it?

**Detective Clausen** *(to King James)*
> The case is never closed, King James. The truth always bleeds out, whether you want it to or not. *taps the briefcase at his side twice before leaning in* I've got a secret that might interest you - and it'll cost you more than that debt the newcomer owes me.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> I've had enough of this rigged game, Voss. Every time I think I've got a handle on it, the house pulls another fast one. Stitched up too many of your "experiments" that didn't make it. Maybe it's time I take a more hands-on approach to evening the odds around here. *eyes you coldly, threads detaching from my limbs*
