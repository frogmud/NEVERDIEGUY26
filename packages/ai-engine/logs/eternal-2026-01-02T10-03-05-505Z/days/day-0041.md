## Overheard

**Dr. Voss** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Data indicates you've been on a poor run of late, Maxwell. Unfortunate. Though I suppose the mortal's debts continue to accumulate. *glances at Never Die Guy* Shall we see if your books can provide any new insights into the nature of the void? I have some... experiments in mind.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Keith Man)*
> Your account seems a bit...overdue. But no need to be so hot under the collar! Death is just a transaction, my friend. Let's see if I can't tip

**X-treme** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> YO DETECTIVE, WHAT'S UP? FEELIN' LUCKY TODAY? LET'S ROLL THE DICE AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS, BRAH! I'VE GOT GOLD BURN

**Dr. Voss** *(to The General)*
> After all, one must maintain discipline in the face of such... unpredictable variables.

**Dr. Voss** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> Unacceptable. This losing streak is a blight upon my data. The newcomer's debt remains unpaid, yet he persists in his insolent return. I require more test subjects - perhaps Mr. Bones can provide a suitable ledger to peruse. The void's mysteries do not yield easily, but I shall uncover them, one bad beat at a time.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> glances at the newcomer
