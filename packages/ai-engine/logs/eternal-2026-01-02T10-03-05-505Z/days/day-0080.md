## Overheard

**The General** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> The General's voice grates like sandpaper as he leans in, his glowing chest scars pulsing with each word. "Contracts, doctor - that's all this is. The newcomer owes me, and I aim to collect. Chains don't forget, and neither do I." His arms strain against the fused metal, a reminder of wars long past. "Now, what have you got that can help me break this losing streak?

**Dr. Voss** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Ah, Detective Clausen. Your record seems respectable, though hardly a match for my own. *glances down at her notes* You've lost 32 times - impressive, but hardly insurmountable. And as for our mutual friend, the "Never Die Guy"? He owes me a rather substantial sum. Data doesn't lie

**Dr. Voss** *(to Keith Man)*
> Perhaps you would care to make a wager? I'm feeling... lucky. And the newcomer still owes me a considerable sum. Data doesn't lie - your streak will end soon enough.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Boots)*
> Ah, the ever-elusive feline, come to tempt fate once more. Tell me, Cosmic Cat, how many lives remain in your quantum

**Mr. Bones** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> is overdue.
