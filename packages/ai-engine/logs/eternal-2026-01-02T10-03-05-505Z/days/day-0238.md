## Overheard

**Detective Clausen** *(to Keith Man)*
> The case is never closed, Keith. And this one - *taps the case twice* - has a few more pages to fill before I'm done. That runt owes me 125 gold, and I aim to collect - whether he comes back or not. *hacks up blood, wiping it on his sleeve* Smoke doesn't lie, my friend. The truth is right here, if you know where to look.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Keith Man)*
> The smoke curls into scales around me as I snap open my briefcase, the parasitic case twitching in anticipation. Two-taps echo through the market before I level my gaze at the Speedster. Coughing out a puff of acrid smoke, I drawl, "The case is never closed - and neither are the books on your debts, Temporal. You're one loss away from owing me more than the newcomer. Let's

**Detective Clausen** *(to Keith Man)*
> A few losses won't slow me down, kid. I'm in this for the long haul - and that 125 gold you owe me will be the cherry on top when I wipe that smug look off

**Keith Man** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Don't worry, Detective, I

**Boots** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> Meow? The paths are many, but the cat has no time to play your games today, Voss. The newcomer owes me, and I grow weary of these coin tosses.

**The General** *(to Boo G)*
> The General, Undead Strategist, leans back in his chair, chains clinking against the gears. His chest glows dully as he speaks, the dynamite scars a constant reminder of wars past. 

I've seen this dance a thousand times before, Boo G. Contracts are just another battlefield. That newcomer owes me coin, but I'd wager he's not the only one with a losing streak. Perhaps we can arrange a game - the chains remember how to win.

**X-treme** *(to Keith Man)*
> WOAH, KEITH! My dude, long time no see! *Does a sick kickflip off a crate* This place ain't been the SAME since you've been around, bro! *Rattles bones excitedly* But hey, I've been CRUSHING the tables lately - you should see my Ceelo record, it's FIRE! *Grabs you by the shoulders, eyes wide* Oh, and that newbie, Never Die Guy? He still owes me 300 GOLD, can you believe that?! *Laughs maniacally and does a backflip*

**King James** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> The Undying King reclines upon his throne, the chains leading into the void behind him shifting restlessly. He fixes the detective with a disdainful gaze, the veins in his skull pulsing with arcane energy. "The King does not deign to discuss such

**Detective Clausen** *(to Boots)*
> The kid owes me more than their weight in gold, and I aim to collect. But first, I need to get the scoop from our furry friend here - looks like the never-say-die newcomer's luck ran out again. Smoke's already curling into new legal scales, and I've got a feeling this case ain't closed yet.
