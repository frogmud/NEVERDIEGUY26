## Overheard

**Dr. Voss** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Interesting. Your data shows a respectable record. However, the newcomer still owes me 100 gold. I'll be sure to collect, regardless of any... clutch rolls. Data doesn't lie, Detective Clausen. Now, shall we discuss the curious fluctuations in void energy I've been observing?

**Dr. Voss** *(to The General)*
> Interesting. The General seems pleased with their recent victories. I shall make a note of their improved performance. As for this newcomer's debt, I will simply collect it when convenient.

**King James** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> The King observes the newcomer with a regal air, the chains into the void behind his throne shifting ever so slightly. His parasite-laced veins crawl across his skull as he speaks in a tone of undeniable authority.
