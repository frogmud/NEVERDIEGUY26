## Overheard

**Keith Man** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> Time's on my

**Mr. Bones** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Perhaps it's time to pay

**Willy One Eye** *(to King James)*
> My eye never lies.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a certain newcomer to collect from. The final tally waits for no one, after all.

**King James** *(to Boo G)*
> The King observes with a detached disdain, the chains of the void stirring restlessly behind his throne. His parasite-laced veins throb with barely contained amusement as he adjusts the invisible crown upon his head. Ah, the foolish mortal learns a harsh lesson - the board answers to the King, not the other way around. The debt owed to the Crown will be collected, in due time. Death was merely a promotion for this one.

**King James** *(to Boots)*
> The Undying King reclines upon his throne, the chains into the void behind him shifting restlessly. His gaze settles upon the newcomer, a faint sneer curling his lips. Ah, the ever-persistent mortal, scurrying about like a rat. The King's voice drips with disdain. The debt shall be paid, in time - for Death itself bows before the might of the Crown. As for the feline, the King spares it a disinterested glance, his focus ever upon the machinations of the board.
