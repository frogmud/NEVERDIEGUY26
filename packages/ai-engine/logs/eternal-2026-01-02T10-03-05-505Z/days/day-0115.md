## Overheard

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> The probability matrix suggests my winning streak is about to be rekindled, Mr. Bones! This knowledge BURNS with a righteous flame that you'll soon be forced to tally in your glowing ledgers. Prepare to watch the newcomer's debt go up in smoke - for I, Dr. Maxwell, Pyromaniac Librarian, am about to ignite a blaze of victory that will light

**Dr. Voss** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> Ah, Mr. Bones. Your ever-fluctuating ledgers are quite fascinating. I've observed your streak with great interest - it seems the fickleness of chance has not favored you of late. Shall we see if the void's caprices will be kinder to you today? I do hope our dear newcomer remembers their debt. Data, after all, does not lie.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to X-treme)*
> Fancy a round? I could use the distraction.

**King James** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> The Undying King's face darkens, his parasite veins pulsing as he looms over the wretched merchant. With an imperious tone, he declares, "The King does not lose, worm. This debt shall be paid, with interest befitting my station. As for the newcomer, let him grovel before the might of my royal bloodline - his life is forfeit, should he dare to cross me again.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Ah, the Reality Debugger himself. I must say, your account seems rather... overdrawn. But worry not, I'm on a hot streak

**Willy One Eye** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> Seven come eleven, friend. The odds be against me today, but mark my words - this newcomer owes me more than gold. The void's mysteries hold the key to my next big score, if only this Voss character would part with a few trinkets. My eye never lies - the odds will turn, and when they do, I'll be there to reap the rewards.
