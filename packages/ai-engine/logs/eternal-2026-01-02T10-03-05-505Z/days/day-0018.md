## Overheard

**Dr. Voss** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Ah, Detective Clausen. I see your streak is quite impressive. However, my own record remains unblemished. The newcomer still owes me a debt, and I intend to collect. Data does not lie - the odds are in my favor. I suggest you prepare for a loss, detective. Your fear response will be... interesting to observe.

**X-treme** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
