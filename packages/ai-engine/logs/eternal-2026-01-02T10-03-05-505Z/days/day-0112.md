## Overheard

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> His pathetic mortality matters not - the flames of eternity burn ever brighter! Now, Mr. Bones, let us speak of the ancient tomes that SCORCH the very soul, for I must add them to my collection before this streak of losses consumes me entirely!

**Dr. Voss** *(to Keith Man)*
> Interesting. Your speed does not appear to have aided you in your previous encounter. *glances down at notes* I'll update the data accordingly. As for your debt, the newcomer's continued survival is... curious. I'll need to conduct further observations. For now, your erratic movements are merely a distraction from my research. Please try to remain stationary, if you don't mind. The readings

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Read fast or it's ash - the newcomer owes me 75 gold, and I aim to collect!

**Mr. Kevin** *(to X-treme)*
> Well, well, if it isn't the Skeletal Gambler. Feeling lucky today, are we? I'm afraid the numbers don't lie

**Mr. Bones** *(to King James)*
> Ah, King James, the Undying King himself. Your account seems to be in order, though I must say, your streak is a tad unimpressive. Perhaps you should take
