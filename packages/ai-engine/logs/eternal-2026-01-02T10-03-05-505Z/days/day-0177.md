## Overheard

**Keith Man** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> darts off, leaving after

**Keith Man** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> You might wanna settle that debt before I spee

**Keith Man** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> even if I have to race through the whole dang timeline to do it!

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Keith Man)*
> As for the debt - consider it a down payment on the secrets I shall soon reveal. Now, shall we see whose streak burns brightest?

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> I've stitched worse, Mr. Reality Debugger. Seems the odds aren't in your favor today. Maybe you should try a different game - one that doesn't leave you so desperate. *counts the wounds on your pride with a bored look, needle and thread ready just in case*

**The General** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> The General scowls, his chest glowing with dynamite scars. Chains fused into his arms clink as he leans in, his voice gruff. I've seen this war before, Voss. Contracts are just another battlefield. That newcomer owes me - the chains remember. I'll win back what's mine, even if I have to break them all over again.

**Dr. Voss** *(to King James)*
> Your move, Your Majesty.
