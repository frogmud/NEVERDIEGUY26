## Overheard

**The General** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Doctor, I've seen this dance before. Contracts are just another battlefield, and the newcomer owes me a debt that must be paid. My streak may have been broken, but I still have the scars to prove my experience. Perhaps we can find a way to turn the tides in my favor - for a price, of course. The chains remember, and I intend to break this cycle

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Keith Man)*
> I'll collect that debt, you speed-addled charlatan -

**Mr. Bones** *(to King James)*
> Ah, the Undying King himself, gracing my humble stall. Your account seems a bit... overdue, wouldn't you say?

**Boo G** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Yo yo YO! Boo G in the house, bringin' that ghostly beat! Watchin' that Reality Debugger get dealt a bad hand, gotta say - that's some sweet, sweet music to these spectral ears. Owe me 250 gold, huh, Never Die Guy? Better pay up soon or you gonna get that bad beat straight to the FACE! Let it ride, let it ride, baby!
