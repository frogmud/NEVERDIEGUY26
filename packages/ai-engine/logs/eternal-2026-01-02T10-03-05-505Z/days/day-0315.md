## Overheard

**Keith Man** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> winner takes all.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Keith Man)*
> The case is never closed, Keith. This newcomer owes me a debt, but I'll be taking your winnings too - after all, everyone bleeds evidence. Smoke doesn't lie, and my streak's about to get longer.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> I've stitched up enough bodies to know when someone's had a bad day, Detective. This heat's got me feeling like I'm about to come apart at the seams. That newbie owes me big time, and I'll be damned if I'm gonna let him weasel out of it. You'd better watch your back too - I've got a lot of old ghosts just itching to come out and play.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Ah, Mr. Kevin - the one who thinks he can debug reality. How... fascinating. As for our dear newcomer, his account is quite overdue

**Dr. Voss** *(to Keith Man)*
> Greetings, Keith. I see the heat has not dampened your... enthusiasm. And the newcomer still owes me 500 gold. Interesting. I'll note that.
