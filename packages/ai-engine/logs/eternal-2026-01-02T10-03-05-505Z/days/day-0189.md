## Overheard

**Boo G** *(to X-treme)*
> Yo yo YO, X-treme! My dude, my man, my skeletal homie! The beats are bumpin' and the rhythms are GHOSTLY, but this cold presence from Shadow Keep ain't stoppin' me from puttin' down these sick flows, ya dig? That Never Die Guy might be pullin' one over on us, but I ain't goin' down without a fight! Time to let it ride, let it ride - this hot streak ain't gonna last forever, so I'm finna make the most of it! That 450 gold's as good as mine,

**Boots** *(to X-treme)*
> shuffles closer, probability

**X-treme** *(to Boots)*
> ALRIGHT BROHEIM, LISTEN UP! This new kid's got SERIOUS guts, DYING on the ante 3 like that! But ol' X-treme's got a score to settle, ya dig? 225 GOLD is a lot of COIN to be tossin' around, and I'm not about to let this newcomer skate on their debt! TIME TO ANTE UP, DUDE! FULL SEND or GO HOME, am I right Cosmic Cat? LET'S DO THIS!
