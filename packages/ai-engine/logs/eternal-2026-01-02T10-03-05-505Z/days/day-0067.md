## Overheard

**Dr. Voss** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Ah, Dr. Maxwell. I see your penchant for flammable literature hasn't diminished. Interesting. I'll note that. As for our recent encounters, the data suggests I've been... underperforming. But I assure you, my research into void manipulation continues unabated. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a certain mortal to collect from. His... debt is

**Mr. Bones** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> ...forbidden knowledge.

**Keith Man** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> Let's roll the dice, see if I can add to my pile o' gold!

**Willy One Eye** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> Heh, lost another roll to the void-tinkerer, did I? Guess my eye ain't so sharp today - the odds are workin' against me. But mark my words, Doc, I'll be back on top soon enough. That newcomer owes me a pretty pile o' gold, an' I aim to collect - one way or another. Seven come eleven, my friend, just you wait an' see.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to King James)*
> I've stitched worse.

**Willy One Eye** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> Seven come eleven, friend. The odds say you better tally up that gold I'm owed, or I'll be rolling for your name in that ledger. My eye never lies - I see the deal you're tryin' to pull, and I don't like the look of it. Time to pay up, or we'll see how the dice roll.
