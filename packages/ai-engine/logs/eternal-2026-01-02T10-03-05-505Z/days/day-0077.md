## Overheard

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> Ah, Voss! Still clinging to those meager wins, I see. While your void parlor tricks may impress the uninitiated, they pale in comparison to the BURNING BRILLIANCE of my knowledge. And that newcomer - the one who owes me a tidy sum - seems to have a knack for survival that even you can't match. Perhaps you should consider adding a little more

**Boots** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> As for our dear friend's debt...the cosmic game marches on. Meow?

**Boots** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Perhaps the newcomer will prove more... entertaining.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> The probability matrix suggests your luck has run dry, Voss! This knowledge BURNS - I'll reduce your pathetic streak to ash! And as for that mortal wretch, he'd best pay his dues before I consign his soul to the flames of oblivion. Read fast,

**Detective Clausen** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> This newcomer owes me more

**Mr. Bones** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Ah, Mr. Kevin, my old friend! What a delightful surprise to see you here. I must say, your ledger is looking a tad light these days - perhaps you've been slacking

**Boots** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> The paths are many, my friend. The cat chooses the one where the dice fall just so. *glances at your losing streak* You've heard the trickster's words - hold fast to your shadow, and the game will see you through. *paw swipes the air, probability tails orbiting* As for the newcomer... the debt will be paid. In time.

**The General** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> The General, Undead Strategist, eyes the Cyclopean Merchant with a cold, calculating gaze. A faint glow emanates from the dynamite scars on his chest as he speaks, his voice tinged with the weariness of a veteran who has seen too many wars. "I've survived more battles than you've had losses, Willy. Perhaps it's time to renegotiate that debt the newcomer owes me. The chains remember, and they're hungry.
