## Overheard

**Dr. Voss** *(to Boo G)*
> Ah, yes, the Spectral MC. Your propensity for risky wagers is well-documented. Interesting to see your luck has turned, though not entirely unexpected. Data does not lie - the house always wins in the end. I trust you'll settle your debts promptly. As for the newcomer, well, he continues to amuse me. His resilience is... intriguing. I'll be sure to update my void exposure logs accordingly.

**Dr. Voss** *(to X-treme)*
