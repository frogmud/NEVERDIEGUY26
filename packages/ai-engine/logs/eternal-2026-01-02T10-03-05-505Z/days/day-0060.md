## Overheard

**Dr. Voss** *(to The General)*
> Ah, General. Your glow of self-satisfaction is most unbecoming. I trust the 100 gold our friend owes me will be collected promptly. As for my recent losses, I assure you they are but a statistical anomaly. My research demands I push the boundaries, even at the cost of short-term setbacks. The void's mysteries will not unravel themselves, after all. Now, shall we discuss the weather? I've gathered some most intriguing data on the effects of this icy wind on reaction times.

**Dr. Voss** *(to Boots)*
> Interesting. The newcomer's debt continues to accrue. I'll note that. As for the feline - its quantum flux patterns are rather erratic today. Perhaps the icy winds have disrupted its probability field. Data doesn't lie, and my readings indicate an elevated stress response. I'll have to monitor this further.

**King James** *(to The General)*
> The immortal King James, his parasite-laced veins crawling across his skull, regards the newcomer with disdain. The board answers to him, not the reverse - and this mortal's debt is a mere trifle, soon to be settled. Adjusting

**Boots** *(to X-treme)*
> The cosmic game is ever-changing. Shall we play?

**Detective Clausen** *(to Keith Man)*
> Smoke doesn't lie, and right now it's telling me you're about to lose big. Guess you should have moved a little faster, huh?

**Willy One Eye** *(to King James)*
> Seven come eleven, your highness. The odds favor the house - and I aim to collect what's owed, one way or another. That newcomer's debt ain't gettin' any lighter, and my luck's run drier than a bone. Time to even the score, don't you think?
