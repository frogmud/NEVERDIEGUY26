## Overheard

**Detective Clausen** *(to Boots)*
> The case may be closed, Boots, but your winning streak ain't. Two-tap on the case before I show you how the truth comes out - with a little persuasion. Everyone bleeds evidence, and I'm here to collect. Smoke doesn't lie, and neither do the odds. Time to settle this debt, one roll at a time.

**X-treme** *(to Boots)*
> THAT'S COOL, COOL, BUT LET ME

**Dr. Voss** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Ah, Detective Clausen. I trust your investigations have been... productive. As for my own affairs, the newcomer's debt remains unpaid, and my luck in the Ceelo matches has been decidedly suboptimal of late. However, the data I've collected on void exposure will prove most illuminating, I'm certain. Now, what can I assist you with?

**X-treme** *(to Keith Man)*
> Anyway, I'm feeling LUCKY today, so how 'bout we raise the stakes and REALLY get this party started? I'm ready to CRUSH the Ceelo table - GO BIG OR GO HOME, BROTHER!
