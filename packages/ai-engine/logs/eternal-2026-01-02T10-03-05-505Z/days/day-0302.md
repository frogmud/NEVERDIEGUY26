## Overheard

**Detective Clausen** *(to Keith Man)*
> The smoke coils around my fingers as I tap the case twice, my voice a gravel-lined growl. "The house always wins, Keith. But this newcomer's debt is mine to collect - whether he lives or dies." I shift my weight, the scales of my cigarette smoke glinting in the dim light. "Let's see if you can keep up with the house's odds.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Keith Man)*
> This one's on the house.

**X-treme** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> That's cool, but you're MISSING OUT on the EXTREME RUSH of the B

**Mr. Bones** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> Ah, Stitch-Up Girl, how unfortunate to see you on the losing end of this game. Perhaps you should have stitched up your misfortunes as well as your wounds. Though, I suppose even an immortal such as yourself can't escape the final tally. As for our newcomer friend, his debt to me only grows, like the trail of bodies he leaves in his wake. Death is but a transaction, my dear, and I intend to collect every last coin.
