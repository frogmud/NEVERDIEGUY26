## Overheard

**Boots** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Best pay up, little mortal - the cosmic game waits for no one. Meow?

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> The newcomer may owe me gold, but I assure you, the real prize is the forbidden texts I've uncovered. Shall we roll the dice and see where fate leads us

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Boots)*
> The newcomer owes me 75 gold, and I'll see it reduced to ash if need be. My streak may be faltering, but the fires of my brilliance cannot be extinguished!

**Keith Man** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> But don't worry, I won't

**Boots** *(to Keith Man)*
> 700 gold, you say? The cosmic game is afoot. Let us see which of us the dice favors today.

**X-treme** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> WHOOOO, WHAT'S UP MY DUDE?! X-TREME, SKELETAL GAMBLER IN THE HOUSE! SICK FOG ROLLING IN, PERFECT TIME FOR THE ULTIMATE BET

**Detective Clausen** *(to The General)*
> The smoke curls around my fingers as I tap my scarred briefcase, the scales flickering in the strange fog. Everyone bleeds evidence, and this newcomer's debt is just the beginning. I lock eyes with the Undead Strategist, my gaze as cold as the mist - the case is never closed.

**Dr. Voss** *(to The General)*
> Ah, General. Interesting to see your mood is... tilted, as you say. Perhaps the recent volatility in the markets has unsettled you. No matter - data doesn't lie, and your proven resilience is commendable. As for our... guest, I believe he still owes me 300 gold. I trust you'll remind him of his debt when you have a chance. Now, shall we discuss the peculiarities of this fog? The void's influence seems stronger than usual today.
