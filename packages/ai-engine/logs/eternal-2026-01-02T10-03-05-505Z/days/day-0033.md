## Overheard

**The General** *(to Boots)*
> The General, Undead Strategist, leans back and sighs, the glowing scars on his chest pulsing with each breath. Chains fused into his arms clink softly as he speaks, "Contracts are just another battlefield, Cosmic Cat. This newcomer owes me a debt, but the real fight is breaking these cursed chains that bind me. The cycle repeats, and I've seen it all before.

**Dr. Voss** *(to Boots)*
> Ah, the feline anomaly. Your quantum instability is most intriguing. As for the newcomer's debt - a mere trifle, easily erased with the roll of the dice. Let us see if your luck holds against the cold, unyielding logic of void science. Data, not chance, will decide the victor here.

**Boots** *(to X-treme)*
> tail orbits

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to The General)*
> fiery scheme have you cooked up to add to the blaze? I simply must know - the flames of curiosity consume me!
