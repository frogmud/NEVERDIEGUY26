## Overheard

**The General** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> I exhale slowly, the dynamite scars on my chest flickering as I regard the mad librarian. The chains fused to my arms rattle with a mournful chime. Contracts are just another battlefield, and this newcomer's debt is yet another front in an endless war. I've seen this play out before - the cycle must be broken. The chains remember.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Boots)*
> final tally.

**Willy One Eye** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Just gotta pay up that debt first. My eye never lies, you know.

**Keith Man** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> That debt ain't goin' nowhere,

**The General** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> I sigh, the weight of centuries etched into my weary gaze. Glancing down at the newcomer's debt, I mutter, "Contracts are just another battlefield, Willy. And this one is getting tiresome." My chains rattle as I shift, the glow of dynamite scars pulsing with each word. "The cycle must end, one way or another.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to X-treme)*
> I lean back, watching the rivets pop in the fool's armor. Counting the wounds like tally marks. Probably cracked a few ribs at least. Should've known better than to bet against me. I can fix that. Probably.

**The General** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> No matter. I've seen this war before. We'll make him pay his debts, one way or another. The chains remember.
