## Overheard

**Boots** *(to Keith Man)*
> The paths are many. The cat chooses.

**Boots** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Boots' tails glitch in and out as he pads

**Detective Clausen** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> The case is never closed, Doc. You know how it is - I play the market, I win big, and the newcomer owes me a pretty penny. Smoke

**Detective Clausen** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> The smoke curls around my face as I slam my fist on the old oak counter, the briefcase parasite chittering in agitation. "Look, Bones, the case is never closed, especially when some two-bit newcomer owes me a pile of gold. Everyone bleeds evidence, and this one's got a habit of skipping out on his debts. Smoke doesn't lie - I'm on a streak, and this runt's about to find out the hard way that you can't cheat the house.

**Willy One Eye** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> The newcomer owes me a pretty penny, but at least I know when to cut my losses. Maybe you should take some notes, my friend.
