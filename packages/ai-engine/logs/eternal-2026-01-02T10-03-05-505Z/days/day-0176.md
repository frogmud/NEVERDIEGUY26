## Overheard

**Keith Man** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> ...flexible. So don't think you can outrun me, Clausen. That 375 gold you

**Detective Clausen** *(to Keith Man)*
> The case is never closed, Keith. You owe me a rematch - and that newcomer owes me 125 gold. Smoke doesn't lie, and everyone bleeds evidence. Let's see if your speed can outrun Lady Luck.

**Willy One Eye** *(to Boots)*
> Time to settle that debt, eh?

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Keith Man)*
> I've stitched worse than you, Speedster. Probably. Though I'm getting tired of this losing streak - and that dust is playing hell with my sutures. Might just have to start pulling out a few threads to get the old luck back. You seem to be doing alright though. *Counts your wounds, frowning* Maybe I can learn a thing or two.
