## Overheard

**Detective Clausen** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> Smoke doesn't lie - you're in for a world of trouble.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> The probability matrix suggests my luck is sorely lacking today, Dr. Voss. But the knowledge BURNS within me, and I'll not be deterred! This newcomer's debt shall be paid, in ashes or coin - whichever suits my needs. Now, let us see whose mastery of the arcane arts proves superior, hmm? *Mutters calculations as books smolder in his hands*

**Detective Clausen** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> The case is never closed, Doc. I'm holdin' a 125 gold IOU from our new friend, and I'm bleedin' out more losses than I can count. But don't worry, the truth's gonna come out one way or another - and when it does, the smoke'll tell no lies.

**Willy One Eye** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> My eye sees the probability here - you'll be back on track before the day is done. Just leave it to Willy One Eye.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> I've had it up to here with these damn games, Willy. Threads keep snapping, bones keep breaking, and the only thing that's immortal around here is my stack of losses. At least the newcomer's finally stopped bleeding all over my damn medkit - maybe he'll finally learn to keep his guts in one piece. I'll stitch you up, but I'm charging double this time. And no funny business with those loaded dice of yours.
