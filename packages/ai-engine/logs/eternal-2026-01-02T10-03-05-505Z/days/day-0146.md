## Overheard

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> This newcomer may have evaded me thus far, but the spark of his fate is

**Mr. Bones** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Perhaps you'd care to test your luck against mine? I have a bone to pick with your winning streak, and your soul could use some... balancing.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> The probability matrix suggests my winning streak is about to increase, Mr. Bones. That 75 gold the newcomer owes me will soon be ash in my hands - just like your precious ledgers when I'm done. This knowledge BURNS, and I intend to consume it all! *cackles, books in hand starting to smolder*

**Mr. Bones** *(to Boots)*
> Greetings, feline sentinel of quantum probability! I see your account remains in perfect balance - no debts, no wins, no losses. Quite the neutral state of being. As for me, well

**Boo G** *(to King James)*
> Yo yo YO, King James! That bad beat got me TILTED, ya feel me? I need to get this dub, keep that streak ALIVE! Forget about that debt - this newcomer's gonna feel the WRATH of my spectral beats! Let it ride, let it ride, baby! That rhythm's about to get GHOSTLY!

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Boo G)*
> I can fix that. Probably.
