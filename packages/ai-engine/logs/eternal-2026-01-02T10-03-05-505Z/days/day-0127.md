## Overheard

**Detective Clausen** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> The case may never be closed, but I'll be damned if I don't bleed the truth out of this one. That newcomer owes me a debt, and I'll be collecting - even if I have to go through your ledgers to do it. Everyone bleeds evidence, Bones, and I aim to have my pound of flesh.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> The case is never closed, doc. That punk owes me 125 gold - and I'm not leavin' here until I get my damn money. Smoke don't lie, and neither do my books. Time to settle this 'fore I lose another hand.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> Stitch-Up Girl's stitched jaw tightens as she watches the Cyclopean Merchant's misfortune, her remaining eye narrowing with a glimmer of dark amusement. She leans in, her thread-limbs twitching, and murmurs, "Rough night, Willy? I can fix that. Probably. Though you might want to check for any new holes - I've stitched worse.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to X-treme)*
> Lucky for you, I'm feeling generous today. Might even let you walk away with a few pieces still attached.
