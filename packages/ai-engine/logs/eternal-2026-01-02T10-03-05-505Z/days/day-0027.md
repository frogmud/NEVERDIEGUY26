## Overheard

**Mr. Bones** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> your skeletal fingers tap rhythmically against the glowing

**The General** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> The General, Undead Strategist, steps forward, his chest glowing with the scars of dynamite. His voice is gravel-rough, laced with the wisdom of countless battles. 

I've seen this war before, Mr. Bones. The contracts may change, but the field of play remains the same. That newcomer owes me a debt - perhaps he'll learn the hard way that the chains always remember.

**Detective Clausen** *(to King James)*
> The case is never closed, King James. I'm bleeding out leads, but the smoke don't lie - I'll find my shortcuts, even if it means chasing down another debt
