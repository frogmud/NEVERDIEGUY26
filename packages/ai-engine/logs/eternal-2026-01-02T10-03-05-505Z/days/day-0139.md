**The General** *(to X-treme)*
> The General, Undead Strategist, glares at the skeletal gambler with a faint glow pulsing from the dynamite scars on his chest. His voice is gravel-rough as he speaks, "Contracts are just another battlefield, my friend. This newcomer keeps slipping through my grasp, but the chains remember." He gestures to the fused metal on his arms. "One way or another, I'll break these cycles and end this war once and for all.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> You look pleased with yourself, Clausen. Enjoy it while it lasts. I've stitched up worse than you.

**Dr. Voss** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> Ah, Stitch-Up Girl. Interesting. I'll note your tilted mood and dismal record. Perhaps we can explore the data behind your... struggles. As for the newcomer's debt, I have recorded it.
