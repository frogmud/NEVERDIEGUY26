## Overheard

**Mr. Bones** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Well, well, if it isn't the good doctor. Seems your record is a bit... heated. But I suppose that's to be expected when you're playing with fire. Now, I have a little matter to discuss - a certain debt that's been accruing interest. The newcomer owes me 250 gold, and I'm afraid his account is... overdue.

**Dr. Voss** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> Ah, Willy One Eye. Fascinating. Your loss streak indicates a degree of frustration, though your emotional responses are largely irrelevant to my research. Regarding the newcomer's debt - I'll be sure to collect that data point. Now, shall we discuss the mechanics of our next game? I'm quite eager to observe the interplay of chance and the human psyche.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to The General)*
> The probability matrix suggests your parasitic assets are far more potent than my pyrotechnic displays, General! But mark my words - this knowledge BURNS, and I'll recoup my losses with a few well-placed sparks. That upstart Never Die Guy may owe me gold, but his true debt is to the inferno of forbidden wisdom I wield! *cackles, gesticulating wildly as books in his hands begin to smolder*
