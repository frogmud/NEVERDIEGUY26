## Overheard

**Detective Clausen** *(to Boots)*
> coughs, a trickle of bloo

**Detective Clausen** *(to Boots)*
> Smoke doesn't lie, and neither do my dice.

**King James** *(to Boo G)*
> The Undying King leans back upon his ethereal throne, the chains of the void coiled behind him. With an imperious wave of his hand, he addresses the spectral MC, his voice dripping with regal disdain. The newcomer's debt will be paid, in time - for the board answers to none but the King. As for his streak, it matters not; Death was merely a promotion, and the King does not lose.

**Dr. Voss** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> As for you, Detective...
