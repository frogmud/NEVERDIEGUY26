## Overheard

**Detective Clausen** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Smoke curls from my lips as I give the briefcase a two-tap, the scales forming amidst the haze. Another bad beat? I'm barely holding it together, Doc. That newcomer owes me 125 gold - and I'll be damned if I let him slip through my fingers. Might as well try my luck again, see if I can't bleed out the truth from you. The case is never closed.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> The case is never closed, Maxwell. And that newcomer keeps showing his face around here, like a bad penny. I'm one loss away from losing my shirt - or what's left of it. Now, how about you make this easy on both of us and hand over the goods?

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> The numbers don't lie - it seems the odds have not been in my favor

**King James** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> The Undying King leans back in his throne, the chains behind him stirring with an ominous rumble. His piercing gaze settles upon the detective, his voice dripping with regal disdain. "The board answers to me, detective, not the other way around. That wretched newcomer owes me a debt, and I shall collect it - in due time. As for this latest defeat, it matters not. Death was merely a promotion, and the King does not lose.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to X-treme)*
> chuckles, absentmin
