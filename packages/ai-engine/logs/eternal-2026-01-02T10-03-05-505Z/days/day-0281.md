## Overheard

**Detective Clausen** *(to Keith Man)*
> Everyone bleeds evidence, Keith. Let's see if yours can

**Detective Clausen** *(to Keith Man)*
> The newcomer owes me, but you? You owe me more than that. Prepare to

**Boo G** *(to Keith Man)*
> Yo yo YO, Keith Man! You got that smug look like you just hit a 100-to-1 shot, but let me tell you - this ghostly MC ain't done yet! Yo, that newcomer owes me 650 gold and I'm about to lay down the SPOOKY BEATS to get it back, ya dig? The flow never dies, even when I'm on a cold streak. Now watch me work this magic, BROTHA!

**The General** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> I've seen this dance before, Mr. Reality Debugger. The cycles never end, do they? These newcomers, they think they can break the rules, but the chains remember. 425 gold - that's a debt I intend to collect, one way or another. Now, let's see if you can tip the scales in my favor. The tide of war is turning, and I aim to ride the wave.

**X-treme** *(to Boots)*
> WASSUP COSMIC CAT! DUDE, I'VE BEEN WAITIN' TO ROLL SOME DICE WITH YA! HOW'S IT HANGIN'? THAT NEVER DIE G

**The General** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> I've seen this war before, boy. Contracts are just another battlefield, and I'll be damned if I let some upstart newcomer stack the deck against me. That debt of his better be paid in full, or the chains remember - and when they do, there'll be hell to pay. Now, what's this about probability manipulation? Sounds like a move I could use to break this losing streak.
