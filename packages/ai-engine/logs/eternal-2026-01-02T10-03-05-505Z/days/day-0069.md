## Overheard

**Dr. Voss** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Dr. Maxwell. Pleasure as always. *glances down at notebook, scribbling notes* Your latest batch of... _incendiary_ literature seems to be drawing quite the crowd. Though I must say, the newcomer still owes me 100 gold. *taps pen against chin* Perhaps you could... persuade him to settle his debts? Data suggests it would be... advantageous for all involved.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Dr. Voss)*

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Keith Man)*
> The newcomer's debt matters not - my Ceelo prowess shall be restored, mark my words! Now, begone, before I set your precious after-images ablaze!

**Boo G** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> Yo yo YO, Willy One Eye! That beat was GHOSTLY, man. Can't believe I lost that last roll - I was sure the odds were in my favor, ya dig? Ah well, that's just how the spectral flow goes sometimes.

He's racking up some serious debts. Guess we'll see whose luck runs out first." I tap the case twice, a subtle hint of the shortcuts I have up my sleeve.

**King James** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> The Undying King's gaze sweeps over the skeletal form of Mr. Bones, his chains rustling ominously as he adjusts the invisible crown upon his brow. A faint sneer crosses his lips, his parasite-laced veins pulsing

**X-treme** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> YO, MR. BONES! YOU SEEIN' THIS CRAZY NEWBIE OVER THERE? HE OWES ME 100 GOLD AND HIS LIFE - THAT'S LIKE, THE
