**Detective Clausen** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> The smoke curled into scales as I gave a sharp two-tap on my battered case. The newcomer owed me more than just gold - I needed the truth, and I always got what I was owed. The case was never closed, and everyone bled evidence. I coughed up a crimson trail, meeting the pyromaniac's smug gaze. The fog whispered secrets, but I'd extract the truth one way or another.
