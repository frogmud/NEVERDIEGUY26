## Overheard

**Dr. Voss** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> Data indicates the newcomer's debts are overdue. Perhaps we can discuss a... voluntary contribution to my research. As for your smugness, Mr. Bones, I suggest you temper your glee - the void's fickle nature may yet deliver an unexpected outcome. My streak will resume shortly. The data does not lie.

**Dr. Voss** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Your smugness is... predictable. As for the newcomer's debt, I'll simply add it to the growing pile of data I've collected on his... resilience. Data doesn't lie, after all.

**Dr. Voss** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Ah, Detective Clausen. I'd offer you a seat, but I'm quite certain it would be occupied by yet another unsavory patron eager to take my gold. The newcomer's debt remains unpaid, and my streak of losses continues to vex me. Shall we discuss the matter, or would you prefer to gloat over my misfortune? The data, I'm sure, will be most enlightening.
