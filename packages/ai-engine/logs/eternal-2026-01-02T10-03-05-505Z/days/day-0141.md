## Overheard

**Detective Clausen** *(to Boots)*
> Smoke don't lie, and neither do I. Let's roll the dice and see who's

**Boots** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> A soft chuckle rumbles in the cat's throat as it turns to the newcomer.

**Boots** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> Boots' multiple tails glitch in and out, hinting at hidden layers

**Boots** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> The paths are many. The cat chooses... when to pounce.

**Boo G** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Yo yo YO! Boo G, Spectral MC in the house! This newcomer ain't got nothin' on me, ya dig? That beat you just dropped, Dr. Maxwell? Weak sauce, fam. I'm talkin' ghostly beats that'll shake the very foundations of this market! And that debt the Never Die Guy owes me? That's just the beginning - I'm about to lay down some sick gambling rhythms that'll have him beggin' for mercy. Let it ride, let it ride! This Spectral MC's just gettin' started.

**The General** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> I've weathered a thousand battles, Willy, but this newcomer's debt weighs on me like a millstone. The chains remember, and they long to be broken. Let's see if we can't turn the tide - a throw of the dice, a clash of steel. Victory may yet be ours.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> Willy, my friend, the numbers don't lie - this newcomer is a statistical anomaly, a glitch in the fabric of reality. 225 gold? Tsk, tsk, a mere drop in the ocean of my vast holdings. But mark my words, the tide will turn, the scales will balance. This... streak of losses? Merely a temporary setback, a blip on the radar of my grand design. I'll have what's owed, one way or another. After all, you already know - this is all... calculated.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Ah, Dr. Maxwell, still burning the candle at both ends, I see. Perhaps
