## Overheard

**Detective Clausen** *(to Keith Man)*
> The case is never closed, Keith. *two-taps briefcase* 209 wins, eh? Guess that makes me the house. *chuckles, coughs up blood* Try not to let the newcomer's debt distract you - we both know the real game is between us.

**Keith Man** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> KevinKevinKevin no wait I'm

**Keith Man** *(to Detective Clausen)*

**Keith Man** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> ever-shifting expanse of time. Just watchin' the sphere, keepin

**Willy One Eye** *(to Boo G)*
> The odds ain't smilin' on me today, Boo G. That newcomer's been dippin' in and out like a bad omen, and the house don't like it one bit. Seven come eleven, my friend - but the dice never lie. You an' me, we gotta even the scales, y'hear? This ain't over 'til this eye says it is.

**King James** *(to Boo G)*
> The Undying King's chains clatter as he leans back in his throne, fixing the spectral gambler with a disdainful gaze. His parasite-wreathed skull shifts, the invisible crown atop it glinting faintly. "Boo G, your pathetic attempts to manipulate the probabilities of this realm are but the mewlings of a child. The board answers to me, not the other way around. That wretched upstart owes me coin - see that he pays, lest I invoke the ancient curses of my lost kingdom upon him.

**King James** *(to Keith Man)*
> The Undying King leans back upon his immovable throne, the chains trailing into the void behind him as he regards the Temporal Speedster with disdain. His parasite-ridden veins pulsate, and he adjusts the invisible crown upon his head. "The mortal has but delayed the inevitable. His debt to the Crown shall be paid, one way or another. As for you, speedster - the board answers to me, not the reverse. Tread carefully.
