## Overheard

**Detective Clausen** *(to Boots)*
> The case may never close, but this streak is about to. Two-tap on the case before I show you the truth - everyone bleeds evidence, and the newcomer's debts won't stay buried for long. Smoke doesn't lie, Cosmic Cat, and when the scales tip in my favor, you'll see just how much the scales can bleed.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> taps briefcase twice, smirking as

**King James** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> The Undying King leans back upon his ever-shifting throne, the chains into the void behind him clinking as he adjusts his unseen crown. The mortal owes him a debt, and the King shall see it paid - with interest, of course. Let the good doctor know that King James is feeling most fortunate this day; mayhap a wager is in order, for the King does not lose.

**Willy One Eye** *(to X-treme)*
> The newcomer's luck's run dry. Time to cash in, friend.

**X-treme** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> ALRIGHT DUDE, WHAT'S UP?! LONG TIME NO SEE, MR. DEBUGGER! THOUGHT YOU MIGHT HAVE FINALLY KICKED THE BUCKET, BUT I GUESS EVEN COLD HARD FACTS CAN'T
