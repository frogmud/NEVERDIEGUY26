## Overheard

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> chuckles, idly flipping through a charred book, leaving trails

**The General** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> I sigh, my chains clinking with the motion as I lean forward, the scars on my chest pulsing with a dull glow. This newcomer has cost me dearly, another tally in the ledger of this endless war. But I'll be damned if I let him walk away unscathed - the chains remember, and so do I. This is my domain, and I'll collect what's owed, one way or another. Contracts are just another battlefield, and I've fought this war before.

**Boots** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> The paths are many, the cat chooses.
