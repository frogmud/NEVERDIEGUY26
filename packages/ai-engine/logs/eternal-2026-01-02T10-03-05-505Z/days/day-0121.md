**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Boots)*
> I watch the game with a mix of grim satisfaction and regret, my cold eye flickering in the dim light. Counting the wounds, the losses, the ones I couldn't save - it's a heavy burden to bear. But I'll be here, stitching them up, when the dust settles. I can fix that. Probably.
