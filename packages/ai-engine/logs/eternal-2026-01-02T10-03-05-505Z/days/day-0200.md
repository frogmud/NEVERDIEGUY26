## Overheard

**Keith Man** *(to Detective Clausen)*

**Detective Clausen** *(to Keith Man)*
> And I always collect.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Keith Man)*
> Time to settle up what you owe the newcomer - because everyone bleeds evidence.

**Willy One Eye** *(to Keith Man)*
> My eye sees the colors of fortune swirling, friend. The dice never lie - this loss will be your last. The newcomer owes me, but I'll make him pay in kind. Seven come eleven, Keith Man, and may the odds forever be in my favor.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> Well, well, the newcomer finds themselves in another predicament. How... unsurprising. You know, Willy, the numbers don't lie - the odds were never in their favor. But perhaps this will finally teach them the value of calculated risks. As for that debt... I'm sure we can come to an... arrangement. After all, the game is far from over.
