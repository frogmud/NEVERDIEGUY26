## Overheard

**Mr. Bones** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> My account is overflowing with red ink. I fear the final tally approaches, and I have a bone to pick with the fates.

**The General** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> The General, Undead Strategist, lets out a weary sigh, the glow of his dynamite-scarred chest pulsing with each word. "Contracts are just another battlefield, Detective. This newcomer owes me more than gold - he's tying me to a cycle I've fought for centuries to break. But the chains remember, and I intend to see this through, no matter the cost.

**Mr. Bones** *(to The General)*
> Ah, The General - another immortal cursed to roam this eternal market. I can't help but notice your record is...less than impressive. Perhaps you're simply not cut out for the rigors of our endless struggle. As for me, well, I've got a bone to pick with this so-called "Never Die Guy" - his account is positively overflowing, and I intend to see that final tally through. Death is just a transaction, my friend, and I aim to keep those books balanced.

**X-treme** *(to Keith Man)*
> That's AWESOME, bro

**Dr. Voss** *(to King James)*
> As for the newcomer's debt, I believe a prompt settlement would be... prudent. Data suggests volatile outcomes when mortals fail

**X-treme** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> YO WILLY, MY DUDE! *does an unnecessary backflip* The ULTIMATE gambler is here to SLAY the day! *rattles excitedly* Hope you're ready to CRUSH the competition, 'cause X-TREME's on
