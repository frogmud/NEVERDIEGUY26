**Willy One Eye** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*

**King James** *(to Keith Man)*
> The Undying King leans back upon his shadowy throne, a sardonic smile gracing his lips. His chains rattle as he adjusts the invisible crown upon his head. Deigning to speak, he declares, "The King does not concern himself with the trifling affairs of mortals. The debt remains, and the board answers to me, not this so-called 'Never Die Guy'. Death was merely a promotion for one such as I.
