**Dr. Voss** *(to Keith Man)*
> Ah, the Temporal Speedster. Your agitation is quite evident. Shall I note your distress as part of my ongoing study on the psychological impact of repeated void exposure? The data could prove... illuminating. And do remember, the mortal you owe me still has yet to settle his debt. I'll be sure to record his reaction when next we meet.
