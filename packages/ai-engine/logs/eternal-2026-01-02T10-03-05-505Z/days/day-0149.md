## Overheard

**Mr. Bones** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Ah, Detective Clausen. Just the immortal I was hoping to see. Your account may be in the black, but the newcomer's is overflowing with red ink. Perhaps we could discuss a... payment plan? After all, death is just a transaction, and I have a bone to pick with that meddlesome 'Never Die Guy.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Perhaps we could make a deal, Detective... one that benefits us both.

**Boo G** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> Yo yo YO, Stitch-Up Girl! You see this beat up over here? Straight up GHOSTLY, the way these dice keep coming up snake eyes! That newcomer owes me 325 gold and he ain't payin' up - bet he's scared to step to the Boo G, know what I'm sayin'? Let it ride, let it ride, but this flow's gettin' stale, ya dig? *beatboxes a complicated rhythm, eyes darting around nervously at the loud noises*

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Boo G)*
> This knowledge BURNS! Read fast, or it's ash!

**Detective Clausen** *(to Boo G)*
> Let's roll the dice, see if Lady Luck's feelin' generous.
