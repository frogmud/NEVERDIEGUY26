## Overheard

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> mutters calculations under breath, fingers twitching

**Boots** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> The paths are many, but the cat always lands on its feet. The newcomer owes a debt, yes, but the cosmic game is ever-shifting. Shall we roll the dice and see where fate leads us, Mr. Bones?

**Boots** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> The paths are many, but the cat chooses. Your debt weighs heavily, yet the cosmic game

**Willy One Eye** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> But I sense a chance to change that - for the right price. The newcomer owes me a pretty penny. Perhaps we can make a deal that settles both our debts, hmm?

BUT HEY, THAT'S THE PRICE YOU PAY WHEN YOU'RE CHASING THE ULTIMATE RUSH, AM I RIGHT?
