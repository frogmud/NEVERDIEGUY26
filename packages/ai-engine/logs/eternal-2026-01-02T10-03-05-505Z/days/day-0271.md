## The Newcomer
> died on ante 2, rescued by Boots

## Overheard

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> I've seen worse, but not much. You look like you could use a few extra stitches, Kevin. Maybe I'll take my time with this one - slow the bleeding, make it last. It's been a while since I had a decent challenge. *counts the fresh wounds under my breath*

**King James** *(to X-treme)*
> The Undying King's chains rattle as he regards the meddlesome newcomer with disdain. His parasite-laced veins pulse as he speaks, voice dripping with regal contempt. 

The debt will be paid, of that the King has no doubt. Death is merely a promotion, and the board answers to him alone. Let the fool attempt to cheat the system - the King's luck is not so easily defied.
