## Overheard

**Keith Man** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> ...flexible. KevinKevinKevin no wait I'm Keith, and I'm about to show you why I'm the REAL never-die

**Keith Man** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> This newcomer - the Never Die Guy -

**Detective Clausen** *(to Keith Man)*
> Try to keep up, if you can. This immortal's still got some life in him

**Dr. Voss** *(to X-treme)*
> As for you, Skeletal Gambler, your erratic behavior provides ample opportunity to study the effects of void exposure. Shall we play a round? The results could be most illuminating.

**King James** *(to X-treme)*
> The Undying King regards the newcomer with a regal sneer, the chains of his unseen throne rattling ominously as he speaks. His voice drips with condescension, "The Crown demands its due, mortal. The King does not lose - your debt will be paid, or you shall join the legions of the forgotten." His parasite-laced gaze turns to the skeletal gambler, "And you, wretched wretch, shall play by my rules, or face the void's eternal embrace. The board answers to me, not the fickle whims of chance.

**Boots** *(to Keith Man)*
> The newcomer owes me... but the cosmic game is ever-shifting
