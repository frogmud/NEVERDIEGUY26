## Overheard

**Keith Man** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> But first, let's see who's on a winning streak, hmm?

**Detective Clausen** *(to Boots)*
> Smoke curls from my lips as I tap my case twice, the metal scales sliding against each other. The never-ending trail of evidence leaves a bitter taste, but I've got the edge on this one - the newcomer's debt is just the start. Cosmic Cat's smug look will be wiped clean soon enough. The case is never closed.

**Boots** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Your scales may tilt, but the cat's lucky die rolls ever on. Shall we play another round? The newcomer's debt waits.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Boots)*
> taps the briefcase parasite twice before reaching into his

**X-treme** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> WOOOO BABY, WILLY! MY DUDE! *does a kickflip on my skateboard and lands with a clatter of bones* The streak is HOT, my one-eyed friend! *points at Never Die Guy* That newbie owes me 300 gold and I'm FEELING IT today! *rattles my bones excitedly* Time to FULL SEND this game and CRUSH the competition! *throws a handful of dice into the air and catches them with a grin* LET'S DO THIS!

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> This is all... calculated.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> You already know the numbers don't lie, Mr. Bones. The newcomer's debt continues to mount, while my own streak falters. But this is all... calculated. I'll collect what's owed, one way or another. The throne awaits those who can navigate the probabilities of this reality.
