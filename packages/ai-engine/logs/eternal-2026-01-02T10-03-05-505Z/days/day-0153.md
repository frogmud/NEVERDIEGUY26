> it is always due.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Keith Man)*
> The probability matrix suggests, my dear Keith Man, that your luck has run its course! The fires of fate burn ever brighter in my favor. 75 gold from the newcomer will do nicely to fuel my latest incendiary experiment. Now, where were we in our little game of Ceelo?

**Mr. Bones** *(to X-treme)*
> Ah, the ol' bone collector himself. Can't say I'm surprised to see you, X-treme - seems your luck's as rotten as mine. But hey, what can I say? Death is just a transaction, my friend. And this newcomer? Hmph, he's racked up quite the debt. I've got a bone to pick with that one. But enough chit-chat - how about we roll the bones and see who's the real master of the game, eh?

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Mr. Bones)*
