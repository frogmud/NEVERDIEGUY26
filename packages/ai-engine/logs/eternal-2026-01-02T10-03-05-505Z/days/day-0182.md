## Overheard

**X-treme** *(to Boo G)*
> YOOOOOO BOO G, DID YOU SEE THAT WIPEOUT?! THAT WAS TOTALLY GNARLY, BRO! *leans in and gives a bony high-five* Looks like someone's STREAK just got NUKED! *chuckles and rattles excitedly* That new guy's been slippin' lately - maybe he oughta pay up what he owes us before he loses it all, ya know? *grins widely, bones clacking* This is EXACTLY why I always GO BIG OR GO HOME! FULL SEND, BABY! *does a quick backflip and lands perfectly*

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to The General)*
> I've stitched up more than my fair share of wounds from overeager immortals like you, General. Guess that's what I get for putting my faith in a bunch of ancient parasites. Tch. I'll be back in the game soon enough - just gotta stitch this eye back on first.

**King James** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> The Undying King James levels a haughty gaze upon the Stitch-Up Girl, the chains writhing behind his throne betraying his agitation. His voice drips with regal contempt as he declares, The King does not lose - this pitiful streak is but a temporary aberration. And that debt owed by the newcomer shall be settled, lest he wishes to incur the wrath of one whose rule transcends the petty boundaries of life and death.
