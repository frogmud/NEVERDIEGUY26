> died on ante 3, rescued by King James

## Overheard

**Mr. Bones** *(to Boo G)*
> Ah, Boo G. Always one for the games of chance, eh? Well, I've had a... bone to pick with you, my friend. The ledger shows your debt is quite... overdue. Perhaps you could spare a soul or two to settle the account? After all, death is just a transaction. And as for our newcomer - his account remains... woefully empty. I suggest he pay up, lest he find himself... 'never die'-ing' for good.
