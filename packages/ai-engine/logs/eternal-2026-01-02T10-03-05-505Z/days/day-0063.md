## Overheard

**The General** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> The General, Undead Strategist, turns his glowing, scarred chest towards Dr. Voss, the chains fused into his arms clinking with the movement. His voice is measured, tinged with the weariness of centuries of war. 

I've seen this war before, Voss. Contracts are just another battlefield. But the newcomer owes me, and I aim to collect. Shall we see whose strategy prevails today?

**The General** *(to Boots)*
> I've seen this war before, Boots. The newcomer owes me a debt, but the true battle is within. These chains remember the weight of my failures - I'll have to break them one link at a time. Contracts are just another battlefield, and I intend to turn the tides. My explosive veins pulse with the need for victory - this is my domain, and I'll claim it once more.

**Boots** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> lets out a knowing stare, paw smears revealing hidden chains

**Keith Man** *(to King James)*
> Gotta-go-gotta-go-gotta-- Time is... *twitch* ...flexible. That newcomer, always getting into trouble, eh, King James?

**Willy One Eye** *(to Boo G)*
> Now, about that newcomer - he's runnin' up a debt he can't pay. Might be time to collect.

**King James** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> The Undying King leans back upon his invisible throne, the chains into the void behind him rattling softly. His parasite-laced gaze fixes upon the newcomer, a disdainful smirk tugging at his lips. "The board answers to me, mortal. Your debt remains, and the King's luck is not so easily swayed. Let us see if your pitiful resurrections can match the immortal might of the Undying.
