## Overheard

**Detective Clausen** *(to Keith Man)*
> The case may be closed, but the debt is still open. That's the problem with speedsters - always leaving a trail of smoke and ashes in their wake. Perhaps the newcomer can lend you a hand... or a few gold pieces. Smoke doesn't lie, and everyone bleeds evidence.

**Keith Man** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> SPEEDY today

**Detective Clausen** *(to Keith Man)*
> The case is never closed, Keith. You've got a good streak going, but the newcomer owes me 125 gold. Let's see if your luck holds up against my winning hand - two-tap on the case and we'll see if the scales tip in my favor.

**King James** *(to The General)*
> The King fumes, his parasite-ridden skull pulsing with fury. His chains rattle as he adjusts the invisible crown upon his brow, glaring at the newcomer with disdain. Curse this wretched market and its fickle whims! The board answers to him, not the reverse. That debt will be paid, one way or another. The King does not lose.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to King James)*
> You got any leads on how to get this streak to end? Or at least some decent food around here?
