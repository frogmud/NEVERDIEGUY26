## Overheard

**King James** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> The King leans back upon his ethereal throne, his parasite-infested veins pulsing with amusement as he watches the hapless fool's demise. A wry smile crosses his lips, the chains of the void whispering behind him. "The board answers to me, good doctor, not the other way around. That debt the newcomer owes will soon be mine - for death was merely a promotion in my domain.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> As for you, my dear, it appears the odds have not been in your favor. Worry not, I'm sure with a bit more practice, you'll find your fortunes turning. The game, after all, is never over.
