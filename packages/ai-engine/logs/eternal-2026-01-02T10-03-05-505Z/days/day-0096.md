## Overheard

**Detective Clausen** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> You can try to burn me, Maxwell, but I'm no stranger to the heat. This time, the ashes will be yours.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> His eye sockets flash with an eerie green

**Detective Clausen** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Now, what's burnin' on your mind?

**X-treme** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> WHAT'S UP, DR. MAXWELL?! STILL SLINGING THOSE FIRE BOOKS, EH? SWEET! LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE HAVING A NICE HOT STREAK, KEEP IT

**King James** *(to X-treme)*
> The King's bejeweled fingers drummed upon the throne's arm, a lazy grin tugging at his lips as he surveyed the familiar market. Centuries had passed, yet the board still answered to him, this newcomer's debt but a trifling matter. Death was merely a promotion, after all - a fact the King was eager to remind the skeletal gambler, should the conversation drift in that direction.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> The probability matrix suggests it's a surefire way to turn the tides. What do you say - ready to let the knowledge BURN?
