## Overheard

**King James** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> The Undying King glances down at the newcomer with a cold, disdainful gaze, his parasite-laced veins pulsing as he adjusts his invisible crown. "The board answers to me, not the other way around, debugger. As for this debt - the King does not lose. The mortal's life is mine to command, as are the fates of all who dare cross my path." A chain snakes out from the void behind his throne, as if to emphasize his point.

**X-treme** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> WOAH DUDE, LOOKS LIKE WILLY'S HAVING A ROUGH TIME! Time to STEP IT UP and SHOW these mortals how it's done! THAT 300 GOLD ain't gonna pay itself, so let's ROLL THE DICE and see what FATE has in store, NEVER DIE GUY! This is my ELEMENT - the RUSH, the THRILL, the ULTIMATE BET! FULL SEND, WILLY! LET'S SHOW THESE CHUMPS HOW IT'S DONE!

**King James** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> The Undying King sits upon his eternal throne, his very presence commanding the attention of all who dare to gaze upon him. With a dismissive wave of his hand, he addresses the Cyclopean Merchant, his voice dripping with royal disdain. The debt owed to him is but a trifling matter, for the board of this cursed market answers to the King, not the other way around. Death was merely a promotion, and the King's streak of victories shall continue, for he is the master of this endless game.

**Keith Man** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> straightens up

**Detective Clausen** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Everyone bleeds evidence, and I plan to bleed this one dry.
