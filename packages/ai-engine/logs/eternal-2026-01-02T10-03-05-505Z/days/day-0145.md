## Overheard

**Keith Man** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> That new guy owes me 375 gold, but I'll collect

**Boo G** *(to Keith Man)*
> Yo yo YO! This newcomer, Never Die Guy, is KILLIN' me, Keith Man! Dude keeps comin' back for more, but I ain't got no beats to lay down on him. This losing streak is GHOSTLY, you feel me? I need to find some sick rhythms to turn the tide, but my ceelo record is ROUGH. Time to let it ride, let it ride! This newcomer's got some serious grit, but I'mma show him the spectral flow, ya dig?

**The General** *(to X-treme)*
> I watch the spectacle, the chains fused into my arms a testament to a lifetime of conflict. Contracts, the battlefield - it's all the same. That newcomer owes me a debt, but today I'll let the Skeletal Gambler take the fall. The cycle continues, and I'll be here when it's time to break the chains once more.
