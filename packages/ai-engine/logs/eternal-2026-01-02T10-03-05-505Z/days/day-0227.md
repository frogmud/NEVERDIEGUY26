> flumed home from ante 1

## Overheard

**Keith Man** *(to King James)*
> But I've got a game to win first - can't let this losing streak mess with my perfect record, now can I?

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Keith Man)*
> How about we make this interesting - double or nothing on the next game. I could use the coin to pay off some debts.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Perhaps we can... renegotiate the terms. After all, what's a few more losses when you've got an eternity to play?

**X-treme** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> YOOOO, IT'S X-TREME, SKELETAL GAMBLER IN THE HOUSE! *does a sick kickflip and lands perfectly* Alright, Reality Debugger, listen up! That newcomer, Never Die Guy, owes me 300 gold - and I'm feeling LUCKY today! *rattles bones excitedly* I'm on a hot streak, bro, and I'm about to SEND IT even harder! *grins widely, eyes glowing* So what's this cryptic warning you've got, huh? BRING IT ON, I'M READY FOR THE ULTIMATE BET! *fist pumps enthusiastically*
