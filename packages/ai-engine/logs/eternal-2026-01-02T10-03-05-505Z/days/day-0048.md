## Overheard

**Dr. Voss** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Ah, Detective Clausen. Your record is... impressive. However, the data shows your emotional state is currently unstable. Irrational decisions tend to lead to unfavorable outcomes. I suggest you temper your enthusiasm - the newcomer still owes me a substantial debt. Shall we proceed with our game? I have a streak to maintain.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Keith Man)*
> This one's on me - but don't think that clears your debt.

**Willy One Eye** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> My eye sees the odds, friend - and the odds are not in my favor. That newcomer owes me a hundred gold, but I ain't collecting from a dead man, even one who won't stay dead. Maybe the good doctor here can help me turn the tide, if he's feeling lucky. Seven come eleven, I say - but it's been three losses in a row. My grin's getting harder to hold up, I'll tell you what.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> I watch the scientist with my good eye, a thread snapping taut between my fingers. Probably best to keep my distance - these Void experiments always end up a bloody mess. Though I suppose I'm the one to call when that happens. I give a gruff nod, counting the stitches that hold my jaw in place. You're gonna want to sit down for this one, Doc.
