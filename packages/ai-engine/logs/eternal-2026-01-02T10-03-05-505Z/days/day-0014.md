## Overheard

**Mr. Bones** *(to Body Count)*
> Your account is... overdue, Body Count. Perhaps we should settle this debt once and for all on the Ceelo table. I have a bone to pick with you, and I intend to collect. The newcomer may be a wild card, but I've been tallying deaths since before your kind even existed. This loss will just be another transaction in

**Willy One Eye** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Seven come eleven, friend. The odds may have slipped from your grasp this day, but my eye sees the probability shifting. Perhaps we shall dance again soon, when the shadows lengthen and the fates align.

**Dr. Voss** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> Your own record is commendable, W

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> But perhaps you'd care to test your luck against the True Master of Probability. The throne awaits.
