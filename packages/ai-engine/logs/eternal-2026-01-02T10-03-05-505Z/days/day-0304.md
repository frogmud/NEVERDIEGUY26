## Overheard

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> I let out a weary sigh, my right eye faintly glowing as the memories of past failures stir within. Counting the wounds I've stitched over the centuries, I mutter, "You owe me 125 gold, newcomer. Try not to get yourself killed again - I'm running low on thread.

**Dr. Voss** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Data shows your losses have increased by 3.7% over the last 24 hours, Detective Clausen. Interesting. I'll note that. Perhaps we can discuss the psychological factors behind your recent tilt - your fear response is... predictable. As for the newcomer's debt, the numbers don't lie. I expect payment by the end of the day, or our transaction will require... further analysis.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Boo G)*
> The throne awaits.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> As for our dear newcomer, well, his account seems to be... overdue. Death is just a transaction, my dear doctor, and I intend to collect every last coin.
