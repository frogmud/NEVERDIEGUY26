## Overheard

**Mr. Bones** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Your smugness burns brighter than your books, Doctor. But I'm afraid your winning streak is about to go up in smoke - unlike our friend here, whose account remains... overdue.

**Dr. Voss** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> Ah, Mr. Bones. Fascinating to see your ledger once more. The data seems to indicate your win-loss ratio has improved marginally since our last encounter. However, let us not forget that the newcomer still owes me 225 gold. I'll be sure to collect that debt after I demonstrate the superiority of my void-enhanced probability calculations in our next game.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> chuckles, absently patting a smoldering

**Boots** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> That newcomer's debt keeps me entertained, you know. Shall we

**The General** *(to Keith Man)*
> We'll see how the new meat fares this round. The chains remember.
