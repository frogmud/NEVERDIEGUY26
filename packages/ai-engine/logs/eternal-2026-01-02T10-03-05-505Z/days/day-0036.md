## Overheard

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Boots)*
> The probability matrix BURNS, Boots! That wretched Never Die Guy owes me 75 gold - the odds of him paying up must be precisely 12.345% and falling! This knowledge is VOLATILE, and I'll be damned if I don't extract it from his ashen husk, one way or another. *Mutters furiously as singed eyebrows twitch*

**Detective Clausen** *(to The General)*
> The case is never closed, General. But this newcomer's got a way of making things interesting. *taps the briefcase at his side, the sound echoing like a heartbeat* Smoke don't lie - your luck's running thin. Time to stack the deck in your favor, before I have to collect on those debts you owe me. *coughs

**Boots** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Meow? The paths are many, but the cat always lands on its feet. The newcomer owes me a debt - perhaps I shall let him roll the die, and see where fate takes us
