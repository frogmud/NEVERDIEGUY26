## Overheard

**Keith Man** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> looks you up and down

**The General** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> The General, Undead Strategist, approaches the Pyromaniac Librarian, his chest glowing with dynamite scars. The chains fused into his arms clink as he speaks, his weathered voice laced with impatience. I've seen this war before, Doctor. Contracts are just another battlefield, and this newcomer owes me a debt. The chains remember.

Gonna lay down some GHOSTLY beats and turn these odds in my favor - let it ride, let it ride! *beatboxes a rapid, syncopated rhythm*
