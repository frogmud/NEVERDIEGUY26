## Overheard

**The General** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> The General, Undead Strategist, speaks up in a gruff, weary voice, "That debt's been a festering wound for too long, Maxwell. Time to settle the score - I'll be crushing that streak of yours today. The chains remember your games, and they're hungry for a new victim.

**Keith Man** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> darts away, leaving afterimages trailing

**The General** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> I've seen this war before, Doctor, and the tide always turns. That debt the newcomer owes me is just another contract to be fulfilled. My explosive veins may pulse, but my chains remember - I'll break this streak and leave you in the dust, smug as you are. The cycle ends here.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> What do you say - shall

**Willy One Eye** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> Ach, another sorry soul who's tempted fate one too many times, eh? The dice don't lie, my friend - you're on a losing streak, and that newcomer owes me a pretty penny. But hey, the wheel keeps turnin', and I always land on my feet. How's about we make a little wager, hm? Seven come eleven, and we'll see who walks away the winner.
