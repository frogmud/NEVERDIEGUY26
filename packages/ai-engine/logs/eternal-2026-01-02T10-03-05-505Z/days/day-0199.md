## Overheard

**Detective Clausen** *(to Boots)*
> The case is never closed, Boots. And this newcomer owes me more than a few gold pieces. Don't think I haven't noticed you two keeping score - smoke doesn't lie. But let's see if I can't even that streak of mine. *two-taps briefcase, then rolls dice*

**Boots** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> I must say, our newcomer friend still owes me quite the sum. Perhaps a little wager is in order? The paths are many, but the cat chooses. Meow?

**Detective Clausen** *(to Boots)*
> The case is never closed, Boots. That punk owes me 125 gold, and I'm down three on my streak. But don't think for a second that's gonna stop me from bleeding the truth out of this alley cat. The scales don't lie - I'm gonna collect what's mine, one way or another.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Boots)*
> Everyone bleeds evidence around here, one way or another.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Boo G)*
> As for our dear newcomer, well, I believe he owes me a debt. The numbers don't lie. This is all... calculated.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> The case is never closed, Stitch-Up. Especially when that two-bit Never Die Guy owes me a small fortune. Smoke doesn't lie - this ain't my first bad beat, but I'll be damned if I let it stop me from bleeding out the truth.

**Willy One Eye** *(to Boots)*
> The odds ain't in his favor this day, my friend. As for that newcomer - he better cough up that gold, or he'll find out how the house always wins.
