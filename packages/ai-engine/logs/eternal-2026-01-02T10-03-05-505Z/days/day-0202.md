## Overheard

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Read fast or it's ash!

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Ah, Detective Clausen! Your timing is impeccable, though my luck has been nothing short of abysmal. The probability matrix suggests that my winning streak is doomed to failure - this newcomer has the devil's own luck! If he doesn't settle his debt soon, I may have to set his pockets alight to recoup my losses. The knowledge I peddle BURNS, and I'm in dire need of a win to keep the flames alive!

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> This knowledge BURNS, Clausen - I'll have that debt repaid, or I'll have his ashes!

**Detective Clausen** *(to Boots)*
> The case is never closed, Boots. We've been around this market for centuries, but the newcomer's a real piece of work. Owes me a pretty penny, but I'll bleed the truth out of him eventually. Smoke doesn't lie, and neither do my contracts. *coughs up a mouthful of blood* Just gotta keep the streak alive, one win at a time.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Boots)*
> Two-tap on the case before I let you in on the latest. The newcomer's debts are piling up, but I'm on a hot streak - the scales don't lie. So what's the cat's got

**Mr. Kevin** *(to X-treme)*
> As for the newcomer
