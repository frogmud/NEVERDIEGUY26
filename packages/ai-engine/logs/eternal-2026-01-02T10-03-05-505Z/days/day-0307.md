## Overheard

**Keith Man** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Gotta-go-gotta-go-gotta-- *twitch* Time is... *twitch* ...flexible. KevinKevinKevin no wait I'm Keith. *chuckles* Well well well, if it isn't the infamous Detective Clausen. Looks like your lucky streak is about to end, *jittery laugh

**King James** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> The King, resplendent in his unseen crown, leans back upon his throne of void-bound chains, a slight sneer upon his ancient features. His parasite veins pulse with dark power as he regards the tilted merchant, his voice dripping with regal disdain. Ah, Willy One Eye, the King muses, the board does not answer to the whims of mortal chance - and that ever-persistent newcomer shall soon learn that debts owed to the Undying King must be paid, one way or another.

**Boo G** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Yo yo YO! Boo G, Spectral MC up in this joint, spittin' mad flows an' bettin' these beats! Feels like the universe is tryin' to throw me off my game, but I ain't goin' down without a fight. That newcomer owes me some serious gold, an' I ain't restin' 'til I collect. Now, Mr. Kevin, let's see if we can't cook up some GHOSTLY rhythms an' turn this luck around, y'hear?
