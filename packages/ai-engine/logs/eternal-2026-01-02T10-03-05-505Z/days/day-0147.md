## Overheard

**Detective Clausen** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Looks like Lady Luck

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> And my winning streak demands a victory, does it not? The knowledge BURNS within me, Detective - shall we make a wager

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Read fast, or it's all ash

**The General** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> I've seen this war before, boy. Contracts are just another battlefield, and the chains remember. That newcomer owes me a debt - seems you're not the only one who's been taking losses lately. Guess we'll see who's got the better luck tonight. *a glint of dynamite flashes in my chest as I turn to face the Reality Debugger*

**King James** *(to The General)*
> The Undying King surveys the chaos unfolding before him, his invisible crown glinting in the aberrant winds. A cruel smirk curls his lips as he leans forward, chains from the void coiling behind his throne. "The board answers to me, General. Let the fool stumble and fall - he owes the crown a debt he can never repay." His parasite-laced gaze drifts to the newcomer, a hint of amusement in his tone. "Death was merely a promotion for one such as I. The King does not lose.

**King James** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> The immortal King James, with an air of haughty disdain, addresses the pyromaniac librarian. His invisible crown glints as he speaks, the chains behind his throne rustling ominously. "Ah, Dr. Maxwell - the King's humble servant.

**Dr. Voss** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> Ah, Willy. Fascinating. Your volatility is... intriguing. I'll be sure to collect more data on your erratic responses. As for the debt the newcomer owes me, I suspect he'll be back soon enough. The void seems to have a peculiar fascination with him. *glances down at notes, adjusting void-powered equipment* Interesting. I'll note that.
