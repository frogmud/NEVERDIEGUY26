## Overheard

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Perhaps we can strike a deal, hmm? The flames of our rivalry need not consume us both.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> The case may be closed, but the ledger's still open, Maxwell. *taps briefcase twice* That debt of the newcomer's is just the start of the trail. *coughs, a fleck of blood on the corner of my mouth* Seems like you're feeling lucky - let's see how that holds up. *narrows eyes, cigarette smoke forming scales around me*

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Read fast or it's ash!

**Detective Clausen** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> The case may be cold, but the trail is still hot, Maxwell. That newcomer owes me a bundle - and if he thinks he can slide out of our little wager, he's got another thing coming. *two-taps the case before reaching for a fresh cigarette* Smoke doesn't lie, and neither do I. The house always wins.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> Death may be a transaction, but this is highway robbery! That newcomer's debt has me down to the marrow - if he doesn't pay up soon, I'll have to start taking body parts. And you, Willy - your account is woefully overdue. Time to start tallying up the final reckoning, hmm?

**Willy One Eye** *(to Keith Man)*
> My eye never lies.
