## Overheard

**Dr. Voss** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> Ah, Willy One Eye. Your erratic gambling habits are... predictable. Shall we discuss the mortal's debt to me? Or would you prefer to indulge in another round of your favored dice games? Either way, I will be collecting the data. Your fear response is... interesting.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> You know, I'm running a special on stitches - two for the price of one. Just a thought.

**Boo G** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> Yo yo YO, Dr. Voss! Boo G in the house, spittin' them spectral beats! This place has been BRUTAL lately, I'm talkin' bad beats for days, fam! That newcomer, Never Die Guy, owes me 550 gold and he keeps comin' back for more! I gotta stay cool, but this tilted flow is GHOSTLY, you feel me? Lemme drop some sick rhymes to get my essence flowin' again, ya dig?

**Boo G** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Yo yo YO, Doc! Boo G in the house, spittin' that ghostly flow! Ugh, this Never Die Guy is killin' me, man - 550 gold down the drain and my Ceelo streak's in the toilet! That's some GHOSTLY luck, ya dig? But I ain't givin' up, Doc - I'm gonna ride this wave 'til the wheels fall off! Lemme get one of them burnin' books, I need some sick new beats to get my mojo back! Time to flip this script, ya feel me?

**Boots** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> The paths are many, but the cat chooses. The newcomer owes me dearly. Shall we see where fate leads them next, hmm?
