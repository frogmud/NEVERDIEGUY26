## Overheard

> Best start tallying a new debt, bone-keeper. The Never Die Guy owes me

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> You already know the numbers don't lie, Willy. This latest string of losses is... unacceptable. The newcomer's meddling has thrown the balance off, but I assure you, I have a plan to reclaim my rightful place. The throne is mine - it's all... calculated.
