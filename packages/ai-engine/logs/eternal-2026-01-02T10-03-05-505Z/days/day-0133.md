## Overheard

**Mr. Bones** *(to Keith Man)*
> But no matter, the final tally will be made in due time. Now, let us discuss this game - I have a bone to pick with you,

**Mr. Bones** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> chuckles, the glow of the ledger illuminating

**Mr. Bones** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Your account is... overdue.

**King James** *(to Boo G)*
> The Undying King leans back in his throne, an invisible crown perched upon his brow as he watches the spectacle unfold. A faint smile curls his lips, his parasite-laced veins pulsing with dark delight. Adjusting the ethereal chains that bind him to his seat, he speaks in a booming, regal tone, "Ah, the sweet taste of misfortune. The newcomer's debt to the crown shall be collected, but first, let us witness the demise of our dear rival. The board answers to me, and the game of fate dances to my tune.

**The General** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> The General, Undead Strategist, turns his glowing, scarred chest towards Willy One Eye, his chains clinking ominously. "Contracts are just another battlefield, my one-eyed friend. That fool owes me 175 gold, and I aim to collect - one way or another. The chains remember, and they long to be broken." His eyes narrow, the explosive veins in his arms pulsing with restrained fury.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> The fires of my immortality know no bounds!

**King James** *(to The General)*
> The King rubs his throbbing temples, the veins in his skull pulsing with an ancient rage. His chains clatter ominously as he leans back on his throne, a dismissive scowl upon his ageless features. Ah, the General - a fellow survivor in this cursed existence. The King's eyes narrow as he regards the other immortal, his voice dripping with regal disdain. That wretched newcomer and his infernal luck shall pay for this indignity. The board answers to him, and him alone.
