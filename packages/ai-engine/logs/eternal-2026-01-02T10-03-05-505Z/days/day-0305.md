## The Newcomer
> flumed home from ante 2

## Overheard

**Mr. Bones** *(to King James)*
> But I have a feeling there's more to this than meets the eye. The scales are about to tip, my friend. Best be ready.

**The General** *(to King James)*
> I've seen this game before, King James - a never-ending cycle of contracts and debts. This newcomer, the "Never Die Guy," owes me a hefty sum, but his survival has become a thorn in my side. My chains remember the weight of endless battles, and my glowing scars pulse with the fury of a war that refuses to end. If you think you can break this stalemate, then make your move. The contracts are ever-changing, but I'll be here, waiting to collect what's owed.

**Willy One Eye** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> Seven come eleven, my friend. The odds haven't been in my favor of late, but my eye never lies. That newcomer owes me a pretty pile of gold - I'll be collecting, one way or another. Now, what's this void tech you've been playing with? I've got a few rare trinkets that might pique your interest.
