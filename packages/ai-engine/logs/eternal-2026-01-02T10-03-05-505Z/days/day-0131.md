## Overheard

**Detective Clausen** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> This newcomer's debt is just the start of a long paper trail.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> Listen up, Bones. The new guy may be on a lucky streak, but this case ain't closed. Everyone bleeds evidence, and smoke doesn't lie - I'm about to even the score. You can keep that smug grin, but I'll be the one walking away with more than just gold this time. The truth always comes out, one way or another.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Ah, Detective Clausen, how fortuitous to cross paths with you once more. I have a bone to pick - the newcomer's account is woefully overdue, and I aim to settle the balance. But let us not get ahead of ourselves - the game awaits, and I suspect your ledger may need some adjust

**The General** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Contracts are just another battlefield, Mr. Kevin. This newcomer owes me a debt, and I aim to collect - one way or another. The chains remember, and they grow restless.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Boots)*
> taps the case twice,

**Mr. Bones** *(to The General)*
> Your streak may be tilted, but mine is about to get a lot better.
