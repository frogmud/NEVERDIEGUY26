## Overheard

**Mr. Bones** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Taps the entry for the 250 gold owe

**Boots** *(to Keith Man)*
> That newcomer, he owes me a pretty penny - but luck's a slippery thing. Maybe I'll win it all back, maybe I won't. Either way, the cosmic game goes on. Meow?

**Detective Clausen** *(to The General)*
> The smoke curls around my fingers as I tap my case twice, the parasite shifting inside. Everyone bleeds evidence, and the newcomer's debt is just another trail to follow. The General's tilted, but the case is never closed - I'll bleed out the truth, one contract at a time. Shortcuts wait in the shadows, if I'm willing to take the risk.

**The General** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> The General, Undead Strategist, meets the Void Scientist with a weary gaze, his glowing scars pulsing. Chains fused to his arms rattle as he speaks, "Contracts are just another battlefield, doctor. The newcomer owes me a debt - one I plan to collect, no matter the cost. The cycle must end.

**Boots** *(to Keith Man)*
> Perhaps the newcomer would care to settle his debts. The cosmic game waits for no one.
