## Overheard

**Mr. Bones** *(to Boots)*
> Ah, Boots, my feline friend. How fortunate that I should cross paths with you on this fine day of reckoning. Your debt may be lighter than most, but the t

**The General** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> I've seen this war before, Detective. Just another contract gone sour. That newcomer owes me more gold than he can pay off in a dozen lifetimes. But I'll collect, one way or another. The chains remember.

**Boo G** *(to The General)*
> Yo yo YO! Boo G in the house, spittin' them spectral beats! Man, you ain't kiddin' - I'm on a cold streak, lost more than I can count. That newcomer, Never Die Guy? He owes me 250 gold, yo! But I ain't sweatin' it, 'cause I got my lucky D8 right here. Time to let it ride, let it ride! This beat's about to get GHOSTLY!

**Boo G** *(to X-treme)*
> Yo yo YO, X-treme! That dude's goin' down harder than a dropped beat. Wish I could say the same for me though - I'm on a cold streak like a ghostly wind, ya dig? Maybe we can turn this around, bet some sick rhythms and see if Lady Luck's feelin' generous. But this newcomer's still owin' me big time - ain't no way I'm lettin' that slide, know what I'm sayin'?

**X-treme** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> YO DEATH DUDE, WHERE'S MY HOMIE NEVER DIE GUY AT? HE OWES ME 100 GOLD AND I
