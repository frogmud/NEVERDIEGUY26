## Overheard

**Detective Clausen** *(to Keith Man)*
> Care to make this interesting?

**Detective Clausen** *(to Keith Man)*
> The smoke curls and whispers the truth - my streak may have faltered, but the case is never closed. Everyone bleeds evidence, and I'll have my payment, even if I have to pry it from your cold, speeding grasp. The newcomer's debt will be settled, one way or another - that's the nature of my contracts.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Keith Man)*
> Everyone bleeds evidence eventually.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Keith Man)*
> Smoke doesn't lie. Your hot streak ends here.

**King James** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> The Undying King leans back in his ornate throne, the chains behind him rustling with the chill winds of Frost Reach. His piercing gaze falls upon the void scientist, a ghost of a smirk playing on his lips. 'Tis a curious thing, this sphere. The King alone holds dominion over the board - mayhaps he shall deign to share a whisper of its mysteries, for a trifling sum to be added to the newcomer's debt. Death was merely a promotion, after all.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Boo G)*
> You already know the numbers don't lie, Boo G. This losing streak is just a minor statistical anomaly - a blip in the grand tapestry I've woven. As for our newcomer friend, the debt will be collected, one way or another. All part of the calculated design. *gestures to probability charts floating around*
