## Overheard

**Dr. Voss** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> Hmm, another loss. The data indicates my current streak is not optimal. However, the newcomer still owes me a substantial debt. I shall update my notes accordingly. Mr. Bones, I trust you are keeping meticulous records as always. The void's mysteries will not unravel themselves.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Your account is... overdue, detective. And I have a bone to pick with this newcomer who keeps disrupting the natural order of things. Let's see if you can roll better

**Mr. Bones** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> Ah, Dr. Voss, my dear colleague. I couldn't help but notice your, shall we say, _less than stellar_ record as of late. Perhaps it's time you brushed up on your _death_ -dealing skills, hmm? After all, this is _my_ domain, and I have a bone to pick with anyone who dares to

**King James** *(to The General)*
> The Undying King sits upon his ethereal throne, his parasite-laced veins pulsing with ancient power. He casts a dismissive glance at the General, his voice dripping with regal disdain. The mortal's debts will be paid,

**X-treme** *(to Keith Man)*
> THIS is gonna be SICK!
