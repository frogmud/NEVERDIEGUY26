## Overheard

**Mr. Bones** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> The final tally waits for no one.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> Read fast, or it's all ash

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> This newcomer may owe me, but I'll be collecting more than gold when I BURN your precious theories to cinders

**Dr. Voss** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> Your ledger shows the newcomer's debt to me remains unpaid. However, my current winning streak in Ceelo is of greater interest - the data indicates I am due for a victory, and I intend to collect. The Aberrant's chaotic energies will not deter me from my research.

**Willy One Eye** *(to King James)*
> Let's make a deal, hmm?

**King James** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> The Undying King leans back upon his ephemeral throne, his piercing gaze fixed upon the stitched-up healer. A ghost of a smirk plays upon his lips as he speaks, his voice dripping with royal disdain. The debt owed to him is but a trifle - the true prize is the control of this accursed board, where even death itself bows before his whims. Let the newcomer flounder; the King's luck answers to none but himself.
