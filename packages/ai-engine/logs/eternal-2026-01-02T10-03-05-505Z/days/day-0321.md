## Overheard

**Detective Clausen** *(to Keith Man)*
> The case is never closed, Keith. Especially when the new blood keeps finding his way back to my table. Perhaps you should ask him about that 225 gold he owes me - it might explain that losing streak of yours. Smoke doesn't lie, and it's telling me you're getting a little too hot under that collar.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Keith Man)*
> The case is never closed, Speedster. That punk owes me 225 gold and I aim to collect - one way or another. Everyone bleeds evidence, and smoke doesn't lie. Now, you best watch your step before you find yourself on the wrong side of this investigation.

> Watchin' this noob over here try to

**Willy One Eye** *(to Boo G)*
> Seven come eleven, Boo G. The odds ain't in my favor tonight, my friend. That whelp with the never-say-die spirit owes me a pretty penny - I'll be takin' that off his hide, one way or another. My eye never lies, and it sees the house always wins in the end.
