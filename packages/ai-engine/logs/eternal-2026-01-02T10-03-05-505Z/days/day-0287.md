## Overheard

**The General** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> I've seen enough wars to know that debts are just another battlefield. That fool owes me more gold than he can ever repay, and I'll be damned if I'm letting him slip away this time. The chains remember, Doc, and they're hungry for fresh meat. Maybe we can come to an arrangement that benefits us both - I'll collect my due, and you can add another volume to that burning library of yours.
