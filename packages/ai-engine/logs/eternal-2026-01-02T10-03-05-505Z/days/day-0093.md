## Overheard

**Dr. Voss** *(to Keith Man)*
> Perhaps we could explore that... for

**Detective Clausen** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Smoke doesn't lie, and it's telling me this game ain't over yet.

**Dr. Voss** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Ah, Detective Clausen. I must say, your recent wins seem rather... fortuitous. But data doesn't lie, and I've been carefully recording your patterns. Perhaps we can put your luck to the test once more. And as for our dear newcomer - I believe they owe me a debt that is long overdue. Shall we see if their resilience extends to the gaming table?

**King James** *(to The General)*
> The Undying King leans back in his throne, a sardonic smirk playing upon his lips as he gazes upon the tilted General. The chains behind him shudder with unseen power, a silent reminder of his dominion over the very fabric of this realm. His voice, dripping with regal disdain, speaks, "Worry not, my old friend. The board answers to me, and the newcomer's debt shall be paid. Let us discuss more pressing matters, for the King does not lose.

**King James** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> The Undying King leans back in his throne, a slight smirk playing upon his lips as he observes the Cyclopean Merchant's misfortune. With an imperious wave of his hand, he intones, "Ah, Willy One Eye, the tides of chance do not favor the uncrown'd. Perhaps the newcomer would be wise to settle his debt, lest he find himself at the mercy of one whose destiny is not bound by such trivial concerns as life and death." The chains behind his throne shudder, as if responding to his words.
