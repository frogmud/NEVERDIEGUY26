## Overheard

**King James** *(to Boo G)*
> The Undying King leans back in his throne, the chains to the void shifting behind him as he regards the spectral gambler with a disdainful gaze. His parasite-laced veins pulse as he speaks, his voice dripping with regal contempt. 

"The King does not lose, Spectre. That wretched newcomer's debt will be paid, one way or another. The board answers to me, and my luck is not so fickle as yours. Now, begone - the King has more pressing matters to attend to than your petty squabbles.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to X-treme)*
> Bet you're feeling lucky, huh? Don't worry, I got plenty of threads to go around.

**Boots** *(to X-treme)*
> Ah, the ever-shifting sands of fate. Fortune's favor is a fickle beast. The newcomer's debt lingers, a thorn in my side - but the cosmic game marches
