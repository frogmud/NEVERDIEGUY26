## Overheard

**Detective Clausen** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> coughs up a mouthful of blood,

**Keith Man** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> That newcomer's debt ain't going anywhere, but my victory sure is.

**Dr. Voss** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> Ah, Willy One Eye. Your erratic fluctuations in probability are fascinating to observe. *I take a step closer, my void-infused equipment humming softly* I've been collecting quite the trove of data on our young friend's... resilience. *I gesture towards the newcomer* Perhaps we can discuss a trade - my findings, for a portion of his debt. Data doesn't lie, after all.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> The probability matrix suggests this encounter will be a most illuminating one, dear Willy! Your odds of victory appear rather dim, wouldn't you say? *chuckles, fingers drumming on the smoldering tome in hand* But fret not - I'm feeling most generous today. Perhaps we can come to an... arrangement regarding that debt the newcomer owes me. After all, knowledge is power, and power is best shared amongst immortals such as ourselves. *grins wickedly, book bursting into flames in his grasp*

**The General** *(to Keith Man)*
> Contracts are just another battlefield, and I aim to break these chains once and for all.
