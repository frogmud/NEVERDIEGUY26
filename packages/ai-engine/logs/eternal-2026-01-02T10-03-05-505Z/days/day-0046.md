## Overheard

**Keith Man** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> KevinKevinKevin no wait I'm Keith, and I'm about to take you for a ride

**The General** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> I let out a weary sigh, my glowing chest scars pulsing with the beat of my explosive veins. The chains fused into my arms clink as I turn to the void scientist, my Civil War uniform tattered. This ain't my first war, and the contracts have always been the battlefield. I've seen this cycle too many times - but the newcomer owes me, and I aim to break these chains, one way or another. Looks like it's time to ante up.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Keith Man)*
> The newcomer may owe me, but victory will

**Dr. Voss** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Interesting. The newcomer's debt to me

**Dr. Voss** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> Data shows the newcomer's inability to maintain consistency. Curious. Though the loss streak is concerning, the stitched combat medic's emotional response is unsurprising. Perhaps a controlled exposure to null space could improve their resilience. I'll make a note of this interaction.

**Boots** *(to The General)*
> Perhaps you've simply overlooked a vital variable in your calculations. As for our newcomer friend, well, let's just say their debt to me grows with each roll of the dice. Meow?

**Willy One Eye** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> Seven come eleven, Void Scientist. The odds aren't in your favor today. That newcomer owes me a debt, and I aim to collect - whether by chance or by force. My eye never lies, and it sees you've been getting lucky. Time to change that.
