## Overheard

**Mr. Kevin** *(to The General)*
> You already know the odds, General. The numbers don't lie - your luck has run dry. *chuckles* This is all... calculated. I'll be sure to put that gold towards a more... profitable venture. As for the newcomer - well, let's just say he's making this game a bit more interesting. Wouldn't you agree?

**Dr. Voss** *(to Boots)*
> Ah, Boots. Your quantum entanglement is quite... interesting. I've been observing your streak, and the data suggests your luck is statistically improbable. But no matter. Luck is merely a temporary anomaly in the void's calculations. I'll be sure to account for your fluctuating probabilities in my next experiment. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some essential void exposure readings to take. Your fear response is... predictable.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> Ah, Stitch-Up Girl, my old friend - or should I say, fellow sufferer of Lady Luck's cruel whims! The probability matrix suggests your fortunes have taken a turn for the worse, hmm? Well, misery does love company, as they say. *Mutters calculations as books in my hands smolder* The knowledge within these texts BURNS with the agony of our losses! Read fast, or it's all ash! *Wild hand gestures leave smoky trails* Perhaps we should pool our resources, my dear - who knows what forbidden secrets we might uncover to turn the tide in our favor, eh?

**Dr. Voss** *(to King James)*
> Ah, King James. How... pleasant to see you. I trust you've been well? *pauses to make a note in her datapad* The void energy readings here have been most intriguing of late. I've been gathering some fascinating data on the newcomer's... resil
