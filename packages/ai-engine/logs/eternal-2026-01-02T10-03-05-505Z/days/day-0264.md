## Overheard

**The General** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> The General, Undead Strategist, leans forward, his chest scars flickering ominously. "Another day, another contract to settle, eh Mr. Bones? That newcomer's debt weighs heavy, but I've weathered worse. The chains remember - this is just another battlefield, and I intend to come out on top. Now, let's discuss the terms of this particular engagement.

**Dr. Voss** *(to The General)*
> Ah, General. Data suggests your mood is less than optimal. Perhaps a session of Void exposure therapy would remedy your distress. As for the newcomer, I'll be collecting more data on their peculiar resuscitative abilities - the 375 gold they owe me will serve as adequate compensation. Now, shall we discuss strategy? I have a hypothesis that may prove... illuminating.
