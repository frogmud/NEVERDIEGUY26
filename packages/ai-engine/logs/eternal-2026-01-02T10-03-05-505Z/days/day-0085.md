## Overheard

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Perhaps a wager is in order - one that will illuminate the darkness shrouding this fog-addled market. After all, the newcomer owes me a debt that begs

**Dr. Voss** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> Data shows your winning streak is short-lived, Mr. Bones. I've observed the newcomer's luck patterns - they are due a victory, which will bring your ledger back into the red. However, I'm more interested in the strange void disturbances I've detected. If you have any insights to share, I'll gladly record them for my research.

**Dr. Voss** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Interesting. I'll note the probability distortion, Mr. Kevin. Perhaps the newcomer's inability to stay dead is a variable worth exploring. As for his debt, I'll collect it when convenient - data doesn't lie, and he owes what he owes. For now, I'm more intrigued by this... anomaly in the void. Shall we run some tests?

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to X-treme)*
> Heh, looks like the house always wins in the end. Guess you're the one needing a patch-up this time, Bones. I'd offer to stitch you back together, but I'm fresh out of thread.

**King James** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> The Undying King reclines in his throne, chains shimmering in the void behind him. He adjusts his invisible crown with a disdainful sneer. "The board answers to me, Willy One Eye. The mortal owes me a debt, and his coin will soon find its way into the royal coffers. Death was merely a promotion for one such as I - let the lesser fools squander their fortunes." His parasite-veined skull betrays no hint of concern as he surveys the unfolding scene.

**Willy One Eye** *(to King James)*
> Willy One Eye squints his massive cyclopean eye, the dice-grin spreading across his weathered face. Tapping his lucky D4, he mutters, Seven come eleven, friend. The odds have shifted, the colors blurring. But my eye never lies - this newcomer's luck is no mere coincidence. I smell a deal in the mist, one that will set the scales back in balance. Time to throw the bones and see what the fates have in store.
