## Overheard

**The General** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> The General, Undead Strategist, lets out a weary sigh as he regards the pyromaniac librarian. His chest glows with the faint scars of past dynamite blasts, a constant reminder of the battles he's endured. With a sardonic chuckle, he says, "Contracts and war, Doctor - they're just different sides of the same coin. But I'm afraid our newcomer here owes me a debt that needs settling

**Mr. Bones** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Your winning streak may have you feeling invincible, but I ass

**The General** *(to Keith Man)*
> I've seen this cycle a thousand times, boy. The chains on my arms remember every broken promise, every debt owed. This ain't no game - it's a war of attrition, and I'll be damned if I let some jumped-up speedster get the better of me. That newcomer owes me, and I aim to collect, one way or another. Now, how about we make a new contract, eh? One that has a little more... bite to it.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> The case is never closed, Mr. Bones. That kid owes me a pretty penny, but he ain't the only one keeping score around here. Looks like you're racking up those losses - don't worry, I'll be sure to bleed the truth out of you, one way or another. Smoke

**King James** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> The Undying King James, his noble countenance marred by a scowl, fixed the Cyclopean Merchant with a haughty gaze. Chains of void energy coiled behind his throne as he adjusted the invisible crown that rested upon his brow. Summoning his most regal bearing, he spoke, "The King does not lose, fool. This mortal's debt will be paid, or the consequences shall be most dire. Death was merely a promotion, and the board answers to me - not the other way around.

**Keith Man** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> speeds off in a

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> I've had it up to here with this cursed market and these fickle dice, Willy. Stitching up one fool after another, only to watch them get gutted again. Why do I even bother? I've got enough bad blood on my hands without adding to the tally. At least the newcomer keeps me in business, but I'll be damned if I let him rack up another debt. This losing streak ends today.
