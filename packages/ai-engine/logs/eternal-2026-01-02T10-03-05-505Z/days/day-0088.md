## Overheard

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> Read fast, or the answers you seek will be lost forever!

**The General** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> I've seen this war before, contracts are just another battlefield. The newcomer owes me more than gold - his story is mine to end. That smug skeleton won't be grinning for long once I've settled my debts. The chains remember.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> Ah, Stitch-Up Girl. I see your account remains woefully overdrawn. Perhaps you should consider a career change - I hear the grim reaper is always looking for fresh talent. As for your pathetic losing streak, I'm not surprised - with that mangled mug of yours, I'm surprised anyone can stomach looking at you long enough to place a bet. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some ledgers to update. The final tally waits for no one, not even an eyepatch-wearing hack like yourself.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Just try not to bleed out on the way there.

**Keith Man** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> glances at Never Die Guy
