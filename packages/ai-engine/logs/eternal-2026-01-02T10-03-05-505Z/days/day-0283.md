## Overheard

**Keith Man** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> leans in, taps cane on desk

**Detective Clausen** *(to Keith Man)*
> That debt the newcomer owes me? Consider it a down payment on the truth.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Keith Man)*
> The case is never closed, Keith. You know that as well as I do. 125 gold ain't exactly pocket change, even for a speedster like yourself. Smoke doesn't lie - and it's telling me you've got a few skeletons in that top hat of yours. Let's see if lady luck's on your side today, hmm?

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to X-treme)*
> Mark my words, this losing streak ends TODAY!

**King James** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> The Undying King rises from his throne, chains of void energy coiling behind him as he casts a disdainful gaze upon the Stitch-Up Girl. His parasite-ridden veins pulsing with suppressed fury, he speaks in a haughty, royal tone, "Tsk, tsk, my dear. The King does not lose - that wretched newcomer merely cheats death, as he does his debts. Perhaps it is time I reclaim my rightful place on the board. Death was merely a promotion, after all.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> Perhaps it's time I had a more... permanent arrangement with this one.
