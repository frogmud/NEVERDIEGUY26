## Overheard

**Boots** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Shall we see who fate has chosen today, hmm?

**Detective Clausen** *(to Boots)*
> Time to cash in.

**King James** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> The Undying King reclines upon his ethereal throne, the chains into the void behind him shifting with an ominous whisper. He fixes his invisible crown and turns a cold gaze upon the skeletal accountant, his voice dripping with royal disdain.

The King

**King James** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> The King's veined fingers caress the arm of his void-wrought throne as he leans forward, his voice dripping with regal disdain. Mortal detective, the King deigns to share a secret - but only if you settle the debt the newcomer owes, for the board answers to none but the King. Death was merely a promotion, and the King's kingdom, though lost, will rise again.

**The General** *(to X-treme)*
> The chains remember, Skeletal Gambler. And so do I.
