## Overheard

**Mr. Bones** *(to Boots)*
> Ah, Cosmic Cat, always landing on your feet, no matter how many lives you've squandered. But tell me, how does your precious record stack up against the ever-mounting tally of souls I keep? Your debt may be lesser, but your days are numbered, my feline friend. Now, let us see if you can cheat death one more time - I have a bone to pick with

**Boots** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Ah, the esteemed Pyromaniac Librarian. Your record is impressive, but the paths of fate are ever-shifting. Perhaps today the cosmic dice will favor this immortal cat - and the newcomer's debt will be paid in full. Meow?

**Dr. Voss** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> Ah, the Combat Medic. Your erratic movements and elevated heart rate suggest your mood is less than optimal. Fascinating. I'll note the correlation between your record and your current state. As for your debt to me, I trust you will honor it when the opportunity arises. The data must be collected, after all. Now, how may I be of assistance? My void-infused experiments are always available, should you require them.

**X-treme** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> YOOOO STITCH-UP GIRL, THAT WAS CRAZYYY WHAT JUST WENT DOWN! Saw your rival WIIIIPE OUT up there, TOTAL WIPEOUT! Bet they wish they never stepped to the X-TREME GAMBLER, huh? *rattles bones excitedly* Hey, you know that NEVER DIE GUY still owes me 100 gold, right? But you know what they say - FULL SEND or go home! *does an unnecessary flip* LET'S RAISE THE STAKES, GIRL! You and me, WINNER TAKES ALL! WHAT DO YA SAY
