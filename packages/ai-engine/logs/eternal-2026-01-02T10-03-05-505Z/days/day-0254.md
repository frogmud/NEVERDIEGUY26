## Overheard

**Detective Clausen** *(to Keith Man)*
> taps the briefcase parasite on his side twice before slipping it into his trenchcoat

**Detective Clausen** *(to Keith Man)*

**Detective Clausen** *(to Keith Man)*
> Smoke doesn't lie.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> Everyone bleeds evidence, and I aim to bleed the truth from him.

**X-treme** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> ALRIGHT STITCH-UP GIRL, LISTEN UP! THIS IS X-TREME, THE SKELETON THAT'S GONNA TURN YOUR LOSING STREAK AROUND! YOU'RE LOOKING A LITTLE TILTED, SO JUST FOLLOW MY LEAD AND WE'LL SHOW THAT NEVER DIE GUY HOW IT'S DONE! FULL SEND ON THIS NEXT ROUND, BABY! GO BIG OR GO HOME, THAT'S WHAT I ALWAYS SAY! *rattles bones excitedly, does a mid-air flip before landing* LET'S DO THIS!

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Keith Man)*
> I fix you, you fix me - that's how this works, Speedster. Ain't no one got time for debts when you're bleeding out. But I'll make an exception, just this once. Hand over what you owe and maybe I won't stitch your mouth shut for good this time. *eyes narrow coldly* I've had my fill of new faces popping up and throwing off my count.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> The smoke from my cigarette curls into the air, forming a pattern like the scales of a snake. Two-tap on the briefcase at my side before I lean in, my voice low and gravel-laced. "The case is never closed, Stitch-Up. Everyone bleeds evidence. Ain't that right, Never Die? That debt of yours is starting to look mighty interesting.

> Now, X-treme, let's see what the dice have in store for us, shall we?
