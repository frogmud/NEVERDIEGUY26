## Overheard

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to King James)*
> I can fix that. Probably.

**Boots** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> As for the newcomer's debt, I'll collect when the time is right. Meow?

**The General** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> The General, Undead Strategist, turns to Stitch-Up Girl with a weary sigh, the glow of dynamite scars pulsing on his chest. I've seen this war before, my friend. Contracts are just another battlefield - and that newcomer seems to have the devil's own luck. But we'll break these chains yet. The first infection must end.

**Dr. Voss** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> Ah, Mr. Bones. Your ledgers reflect the steady march of mortality. Fascinating. The newcomer's debt to me remains unpaid, but I suppose it matters little in the grand scheme of our eternal existence. *glances at the sphere, notes scribbling*
