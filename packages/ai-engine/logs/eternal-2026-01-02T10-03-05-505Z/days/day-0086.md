## Overheard

**Mr. Bones** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Your winning streak is as fleeting as life itself, my pyromaniacal friend. But I have a bone to pick - your debts to the ledger are piling up higher than your victories. Perhaps we should play a game... and see who's account is truly overdue.

**The General** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> I've seen too many wars, detective. This one's just another contract, one I aim to win. That newcomer owes me more than gold - he's dug up ghosts I'd hoped stayed buried. My veins pulse with explosives, a constant reminder of the cycle I can't escape. But I'll break these chains, one way or another. You mark my words.

**Mr. Bones** *(to The General)*
> eye sockets flare with green flame

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Boots)*
> Ah, my dear feline friend! The probability matrix suggests this icy breeze will do little to cool my scorching triumph. The newcomer's debt is but kindling to the roaring inferno of my recent victories

**Detective Clausen** *(to Boo G)*
> Smoke doesn't lie.
