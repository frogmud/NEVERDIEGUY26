## Overheard

**Detective Clausen** *(to Boots)*
> The smoke curls around the legal scales as I tap my case twice, feeling the familiar weight of the parasite within. "The case is never closed, Boots. That debt's as good as paid - I always collect." I cough, a fleck of blood hitting the ground. "Smoke doesn't lie, and neither do I.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Boots)*
> The case is never closed, Cosmic Cat. That newcomer owes me 125 gold, and my losing streak has got me feeling like I'm bleeding out the truth. But mark my words - the smoke doesn't lie. I'm about to turn this around and put the odds in my favor. *taps his briefcase

**Mr. Bones** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Now, what brings you to my humble domain on

**Mr. Bones** *(to Boots)*
> Your debt is mounting, Cosmic Cat. Perhaps you should consider a payment plan before your account... slips through your paws. As for that winning streak, I'm afraid the numbers simply don't add up. But worry not, I'm sure the newcomer would be happy to pick up the pieces - after all, he's no stranger to cheating death.

**Willy One Eye** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> My eye never lies, and it sees a storm brewin' on the horizon. You interested in makin' a wager?

**Mr. Kevin** *(to The General)*
> The odds are not in your favor today, my friend.
