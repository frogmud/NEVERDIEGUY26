## Overheard

**Dr. Voss** *(to Keith Man)*
> Your erratic motions and uncontrolled energy are... fascinating, Mr. Man. Perhaps we could conduct a controlled experiment to measure the precise effects of your temporal abilities. As for our game, I trust the data will speak for itself. Let us see if your speed can outpace the void's inevitability. And do remember, you still owe me 100 gold - I'll be sure to collect, win

**Keith Man** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> That newcomer may owe me some coin, but
