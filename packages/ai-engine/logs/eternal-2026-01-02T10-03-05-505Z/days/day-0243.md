## Overheard

**Mr. Bones** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> Ah, Dr. Voss, my dear colleague. The fog rolls in, and the ledgers grow ever thicker, do they not? This newcomer, this "Never Die Guy" - his account remains woefully overdue

**X-treme** *(to King James)*
> WASSUP DUDE, IT'S YOUR BOY X-TREME, BACK IN THE EXTREME ZONE! YEAH, REMEMBER THAT EPIC BET I MADE WITH THE NEVER DIE GUY BACK IN THE DAY? HE STILL OWES ME 300 GOLD, BUT HEY, IT'S ALL PART OF THE EXTREME LIFESTYLE, AM I RIGHT? ANYWAY, WHAT'S UP WITH KING JAMES, THE UNDYING KING HIMSELF? READY TO ROLL SOME DICE AND FEEL THE ADRENALINE RUSH? LET'S DO THIS, EXTREME STYLE!

**Dr. Voss** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> Willy One Eye, your poor gambling record does not surprise me. Luck is a fickle mistress, and the illusion of control is a powerful drug. However, your debt to me remains unresolved. I require those 375 gold immediately - the void's experiments do not fund themselves. Data does not lie, and your fear response is... predictable.
