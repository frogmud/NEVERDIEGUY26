## Overheard

**Dr. Voss** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> As for our mutual acquaintance's debt, I believe it's time to collect. The void's call grows stronger with each passing day.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Keith Man)*
> Ah, Keith Man - your debt grows ever larger, doesn't it? And this newcomer, with his penchant for cheating death... well, let's just say the final tally will be most intriguing. But as for your streak, my friend - I'm afraid it ends today. Your account is... overdue.

**The General** *(to King James)*
> I've seen enough wars to know that debts are just another battlefield. That newcomer's luck won't last - the chains remember what they've seen. Contracts are the only certainty in this cursed existence. If the King wants a reckoning, then let it be done.

**The General** *(to Boo G)*
> I've seen this war play out a thousand times. Contracts are just another battlefield, and that fool owes me a debt. The chains remember, and I'll be the one to end this cycle - one way or another. Boo G, your luck's about to change, because I'm feeling lucky tonight.
