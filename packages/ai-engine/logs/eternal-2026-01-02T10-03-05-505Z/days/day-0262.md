## Overheard

**Detective Clausen** *(to Keith Man)*
> The smoke curls around my fingers as I tap the case twice, a habit that's served me well over the centuries. The newcomer may think he's got tricks up his sleeve, but I've seen more cons than he's had lifetimes. Everyone bleeds evidence, and I intend to collect - starting with that 125 gold he owes me. The case is never closed, and I'll be the one writing the final chapter.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Keith Man)*
> Time's up. Pay up, or your clock runs out.

**Keith Man** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Gotta-go-gotta-go-gotta-!

**Willy One Eye** *(to The General)*
> Speaking of which, that one over there owes me a pretty penny. Guess we'll just have to see how the dice roll, hmm?

**Detective Clausen** *(to Keith Man)*
> The case is never closed, Keith. You owe me more than that newcomer ever could - maybe I'll take it out of your hide, if you

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> Voss! You soulless, void-obsessed dullard! How DARE you gloat over my losses - the probability matrix suggests your LUCK is a mere statistical anomaly, soon to be BURNED away! That newcomer owes me 300 gold and I won't rest until I've charred his ledger to ashes! Now begone, before I set your wretched experiments ablaze!

**Boots** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> But the game is not over, my friend. Meow?
