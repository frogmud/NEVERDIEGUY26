## Overheard

**The General** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> I've seen my share of bad beats, Doctor. But this newcomer - he owes me more gold than I've seen in centuries. Maybe I'll have to remind him how these contracts work. The chains remember, and they're hungry for more than just his debt. Let's see if I can't break this losing streak - for the good of us all.
