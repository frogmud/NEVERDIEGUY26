## Overheard

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> The probability matrix suggests this newcomer's luck is a statistical anomaly! His very existence BURNS a hole in the fabric of reality. But mark my words, Detective - the day his luck runs out, I'll be there to FEAST on the ashes of his downfall! This knowledge simply must be mine!

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Mmm, the enthalpy of combustion is quite delectable...Read fast, detective, or this knowledge will be reduced to cinders!

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Boots)*
