## Overheard

**Mr. Bones** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Ah, Detective Clausen. I see your account is... overdue. Perhaps we should settle this debt in our usual fashion - a roll of the dice. Though I must warn you, the winds of fate seem to be shifting. The newcomer has a habit of cheating death, and I suspect your luck may be running thin.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> to see how the odds play out. After all, in this game of life and death, the house always wins - and I, dear Voss, am the house.

**Dr. Voss** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Ah, Mr. Kevin. Your probability manipulations are quite intriguing, though ultimately futile against the certainties of my void-infused research. The newcomer's debt to me remains, and my streak grows

**The General** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> I've seen this war before, sister. The newcomer owes a debt, but these are strange times. The chains remember - our bonds will be tested. Let us prepare for the mist, for reality here is... negotiable.

**King James** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> The Undying King leans back in his throne, the chains behind him shifting with an unseen force. With a regal wave of his hand, he speaks, his voice dripping with disdain. "Ah, the good Doctor. How quickly the mortals forget their place in this grand game. The newcomer's debt shall be paid, in time - the King does not lose." His eyes glint with an ancient knowledge as he adjusts the invisible crown upon his head.

**X-treme** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> WHOA, STITCH-UP GIRL! The NEVER DIE GUY just WASTED my GOLD on some LAME bet! THAT FOOL owes me 100 GOLD and he keeps COMING BACK to LOSE MORE! But that ain't gonna STOP ME from LIVING on the EDGE and GOING BIG! FULL SEND, BABY! Time to ROLL the DICE and FEEL that SWEET RUSH! WAHOO!
