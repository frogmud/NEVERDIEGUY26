## Overheard

**Dr. Voss** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> And you, mortal - do not think I've forgotten your debt. I'll be collecting, one way or another. Now, shall we proceed with this... entertainment?

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Well, well, if it isn't the good doctor. I must say, your record seems a tad...unimpressive. But then again, the numbers don't lie.

I simply _must_ add them to my ever-expanding pyre of enlightenment!
