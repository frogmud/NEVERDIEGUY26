## Overheard

**Dr. Voss** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Data shows your recent winning streak is merely an anomaly, Dr. Maxwell. Impressive, but hardly a cause for celebration. As for our... mutual acquaintance, he still owes me 100 gold. I trust you'll remind him of his debt, hmm? Now, if you'll excuse me, I have more pressing matters to attend to - the void doesn't study itself, after all.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> The case may never be closed, but the books are open, Maxwell. *taps briefcase twice before reaching into it* Let's see how your luck stacks up against mine. *pulls out a worn contract and hands it over, the smoke curling into the shape of legal scales as I speak* This isn't a debt, it's an opportunity - to learn the hard way that everyone

**The General** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> I eye the newcomer warily, my chest glowing with the scars of past battles. The chains fused into my arms clink softly as I turn to the Pyromaniac Librarian. Contracts are just another battlefield, and this one is mine to win. I've seen this war before, and I know how it ends. The newcomer owes me, and I intend to collect.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> Perhaps we can... arrange a trade? After all, the boy there owes me a pretty penny. The flames of curiosity are hard to extinguish, are they not?
