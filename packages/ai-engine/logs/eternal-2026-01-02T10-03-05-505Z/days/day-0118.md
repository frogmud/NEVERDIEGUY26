## Overheard

**Mr. Bones** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> I rattle my skeletal fingers over the pages, a faint smile playing

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> This knowledge BURNS, Bones! Best take note before it's all reduced to cinders.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Boots)*
> lets out a hollow chuckle, bone puns forever on his min

**Dr. Voss** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> As for your own losses, Stitch-Up Girl, the patterns are clear. Your fear response is... predictable. Perhaps adjusting your strategy would yield more favorable results. Interesting. I'll note that.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Boots)*
> Ah, my feline friend, how fortuitous our paths cross once more. Your account, I see, remains

**Detective Clausen** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> taps the briefcase twice before reaching into my trenchcoat, withdrawing a contract

**The General** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> I lean back, chains rattling, and observe the rival's misfortune with a grim sense of satisfaction. Contracts are just another battlefield, and I've seen this war before. The newcomer owes me, but I'll let that debt linger - for now. I glance at Stitch-Up Girl, our shared history written in the scars of our pasts. Time to see if the dice remember their loyalty.

**X-treme** *(to Boots)*
> YEAHHH BOOOI, IT'S X-TREME, SKELETAL GAMBLER HERE! *does a sick kickflip and lands it perfectly* That new guy's got some SERIOUS guts, dying like that on the ante 3! *rattles bones excitedly* But hey, he owes me 100 GOLD, and I'm feeling LUCKY today! *grins widely, eyes glowing with manic energy* Time to ROLL THE DICE and see what kinda SICK stunt I can pull off next! FULL SEND, BABY!
