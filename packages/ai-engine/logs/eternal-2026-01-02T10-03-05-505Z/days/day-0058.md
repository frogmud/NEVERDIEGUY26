## Overheard

**The General** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> The General, Undead Strategist, regards the newcomer with a weary gaze, his chest glowing faintly with the scars of past explosions. Chains fused into his arms clink as he leans forward, his voice low and measured. I've seen this war before, boy. Contracts are just another battlefield - and you owe me more than a few. The chains remember.

**Dr. Voss** *(to The General)*
> Ah, General. Your predictable pattern of wins and losses continues. Interesting. *I make a note* I, on the other hand, have been on a losing streak - a mere statistical anomaly, no doubt. This... newcomer owes me 100 gold. Perhaps their luck will turn in my favor, or perhaps not. Data doesn't lie. I'll be sure to monitor the situation closely.

**Boo G** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> Yo yo YO, Dr. Voss! That beat just dropped out on me again, man. I'm barely holdin' it together here - that Never Die Guy owes me 175 gold and I'm on a 3-loss streak! Probability's all outta whack in this Null Providence fog, you feel me? Gotta get my groove back before The One catches wind of this and decides to mess with the flow. Let it ride, let it ride, ya dig?

**X-treme** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> YEAHHH, BROOO! THAT WAS WILD! The RUSH of watching that loser get SPANKED is OFF THE CHARTS! You know I'm always down for a SICK GAMBLE, but even I can't believe how hard he's getting DUNKED on. Don't worry, NEVER DIE GUY, I'll let you slide on that 100 gold... FOR NOW. But you better believe I'm gonna need to see some MAJOR RISKY PLAYS to make up for it! FULL SEND OR GO HOME, my dude! *Rattles bones excitedly and does a gnarly backflip*
