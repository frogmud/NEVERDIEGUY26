## Overheard

**Willy One Eye** *(to The General)*
> My eye sees the odds, friend, and they don't lie - that newcomer owes me a pretty penny, but I'll recoup my losses with one roll of the dice. Seven come eleven, and Willy One Eye always comes out on top. *squints suspiciously* Now, what business did you have with me, General? The winds of chance blow strong today.

**King James** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> The King's brow furrows, his chains rattling as he adjusts the invisible crown upon his head. With a regal sneer, he declares, "The board answers to me, worm. This pitiful wager is but a trifle - the King does not lose. And as for this so-called 'newcomer', he would do well to settle his debts lest he incur the wrath of one whose death was merely a promotion." The parasite veins upon his skull pulsate as he turns his gaze upon the Cyclopean Merchant, his voice dripping with contempt.
