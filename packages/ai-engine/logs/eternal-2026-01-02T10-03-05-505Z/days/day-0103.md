## Overheard

**Mr. Bones** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> But worry not, my friend, for I have a bone to pick with this "Never Die Guy" as well.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> I glare at Mr. Bones, my good eye glinting with irritation as I count the stitches on my face. Probably around two hundred by now. You'd think after a few centuries I'd be better at this whole immortality thing, but the newcomer keeps dragging me down. At least I've got you to commiserate with, eh Bones? Let's see how that streak of yours is holding up.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Keith Man)*
> Perhaps it's time to, shall we say, settle
