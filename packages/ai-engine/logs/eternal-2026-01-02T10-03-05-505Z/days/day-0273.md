## Overheard

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Keith Man)*
> The probability matrix suggests I'm due for a WIN, Keith Man! These burning books of forbidden knowledge hold the key - but you can't read them fast enough before they ash! The newcomer owes me 300 gold, and I'll be damned if I let this losing streak continue. *mutters calculations, eyebrows singed as books smolder in his hands* This knowledge BURNS! Read fast or it's ash!
