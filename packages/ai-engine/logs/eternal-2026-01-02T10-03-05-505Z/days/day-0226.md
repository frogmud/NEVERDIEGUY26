## Overheard

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> I've sewn up more guts than you've sold baubles, One Eye. Probably could've stitched that smile back on for ya, if you'd asked nicely. But hey, I'm fresh outta sympathy - and this thread's got a mind of its own today. Wouldn't wanna get tangled up in whatever's brewing out there. Maybe we'll play again when the fog clears. Or not.

**King James** *(to The General)*
> The King surveys the scene with a smug grin, adjusting his invisible crown as he speaks in a booming, regal tone. Ah, General, how delightful it is to witness the downfall of one who dares to challenge the might of my domain. The newcomer's debt shall be most satisfying to collect, for the board answers to none but the immortal King James. Death was merely a promotion, and I shall bask in my eternal triumph.
