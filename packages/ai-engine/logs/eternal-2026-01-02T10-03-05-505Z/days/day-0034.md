## Overheard

**The General** *(to Keith Man)*
> Best not to underestimate the power of the unseen.

**Willy One Eye** *(to The General)*
> Aye, The General, you old scrap heap - your smug look rubs me eye the wrong way. The odds have been against me, but mark my words, this streak ends today. That Never Die fella owes me a pretty penny, and I aim to collect - even if I gotta roll the bones a few more times. Seven come eleven, my friend, the house always wins in the end.

**The General** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> The General, Undead Strategist, stares at Willy One Eye with a grim, weathered expression. His chest glows dimly with the scars of past explosions as he speaks in a raspy, world-weary tone, "Contracts are just another battlefield, Willy. That upstart owes me, and I'll collect - one way or another. The chains remember what needs to be done." His eyes narrow, and the shadows in the room seem to lengthen ominously.

**King James** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> The Undying King's chains of void-touched obsidian coil and rattle as He leans forward, an imperious glare upon His countenance. His voice drips with regal disdain. 

The coin you owe Me, mortal, is but
