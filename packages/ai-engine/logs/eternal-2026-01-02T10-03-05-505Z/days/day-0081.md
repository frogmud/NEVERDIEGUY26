## Overheard

**The General** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> I approach the Pyromaniac Librarian, my chest glowing with the scars of past battles. The chains fused into my arms rattle as I speak, "Doctor, I've seen this war before. The newcomer owes me gold, and I'm tired of these losing streaks. Perhaps you have a tome that can help me turn the tides?" My explosive veins pulse with frustration, but I maintain a civil tone, knowing contracts are just another battlefield to be won.

**The General** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> I've seen this war before, and I'll see it again.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Boo G)*
> Smoke doesn't lie - time to make a new deal.
