## Overheard

**X-treme** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> WASSUP, BONES! Whaddup, my skeletal homie? *RATTLES BONES EXCITEDLY* The streak might be even, but this EXTREME GAMBLER is just gettin' WARMED UP, ya dig? *DOES A

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> I glare at the skeleton with my good eye, the threads in my jaw twitching as I spit out, "Bones, you scrawny sack of dust. How about you tally up that debt the newcomer owes me before I start stitching that ledger to your bony hide?" My detachable thread-limbs twitch restlessly, just itching to get to work.

**Dr. Voss** *(to Boots)*
> Ah, the Cosmic Cat. I've been observing your frequency fluctuations for decades. Tell me, have you noticed any anomalies in the void energy signatures around our new friend over there? I simply must update my data logs. And remind him, the debt he owes

**X-treme** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> YOOOOOO MR. BONES, MY DUDE! *does a gnarly kickflip on my skateboard, bones rattling* That NEVER DIE GUY is KILLING me, brah! Always living on the EDGE, that one. But hey, I can respect the RUSH, ya know? *grins widely, gold tooth glinting* Anyway, how about we settle this debt over a little CEE-LO action, huh? I'm feeling LUCKY today - time to go BIG or go HOME! *slams down a handful of dice, shaking the ground*
