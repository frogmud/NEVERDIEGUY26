## Overheard

**Detective Clausen** *(to Keith Man)*
> The case may never be closed, but I've got a feeling this one's about to take a turn. The newcomer owes me more than just coin - seems he's messing with the natural order around here. And you, speedster, better not think you're getting off easy. When the scales of justice come calling, you'd best have your affairs

**Keith Man** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> laughs maniacally

**Keith Man** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> ...flexible, but my luck ain't. KevinKevinKevin no wait I'm Keith, and I'm gonna teach that Never Die Guy a lesson about messin' with a Temporal Speedster!

**The General** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> I eye the newcomer with a weary gaze, the chains on my arms clinking with the slightest movement. Contracts are the battlefield we all dance upon, and this one has left me with a bad taste. I've seen this war before, and the cycles never end. But perhaps, in the ruin of my rival, I can find an opportunity to break these cursed chains once and for all.
