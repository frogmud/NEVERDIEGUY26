## Overheard

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> I glare at Mr. Bones, my single good eye glowing with irritation. Jaw stitched tight, I growl, "Lost another one, have you? Least I'm keeping 'em alive longer than you, bonebag. Though I guess that's not saying much, considerin' how quick your customers croak." I twitch a thread-limb, the needles gleaming menacingly. "That newcomer still owes me. You'd better collect, or I might just take it out of your ribs.

**Boo G** *(to King James)*
> Yo yo YO, King James! The Never Die Guy owes me some serious GOLD, ya dig? I've been on a cold streak, but today's the day I turn it all around. Let it ride, let it ride - this beat's about to get GHOSTLY! *beatboxes probabilistic rhythms* That newcomer better pay up, or he's gonna get the shadow shake-down, ya heard?

**X-treme** *(to Boots)*
> WHAT'S UP COSMIC CAT! *does a sick kickflip, bones rattling with excitement* Looking sharp, my dude! That NEVER DIE GUY still owes me 375 gold, but that ain't gonna stop me from GOING BIG
