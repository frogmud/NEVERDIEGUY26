## Overheard

**Mr. Bones** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Perhaps you should have kept a closer eye on your books, detective. After all, death is just a transaction - and it seems your account is... overdue.

**Dr. Voss** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> Ah, Mr. Bones. Your smugness is... predictable. While your record may be even, I've been collecting far more valuable data - the psychological profile of our perpetually resurrecting friend. *glances at the newcomer* As for that debt, I'll be sure to collect. The void demands its due.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> But I suppose that's the nature of the game, is it not? Death is but a transaction, and the final tally is all that matters

**Detective Clausen** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> lights cigarette

**The General** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> I watch the defeat of my rival with a cold, analytical eye. The contracts of this war are ever-shifting, but I have seen the patterns before. I lean to Stitch-Up Girl, the chains fused into my arms clinking. The newcomer's debt weighs on my mind, but for now, I say only, Contracts are just another battlefield. The chains remember.

**Mr. Bones** *(to King James)*
> But worry not, I have a bone

**King James** *(to Boo G)*
> The Undying King leans back upon his throne, the chains of the void twisting and writhing behind him as he fixes Boo G with a disdainful gaze. Death was merely a promotion for one such as I, mortal - the board answers to the King, not the reverse. You owe my wayward subject a debt, do you not? Perhaps I shall deign to collect it, in time. For now, I find amusement in watching the misfortunes of those who dare challenge my dominion.
