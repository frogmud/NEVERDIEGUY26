## Overheard

**X-treme** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> WASSUP, DOC?! Looks like SOMEONE'S been cheating at the tables again, huh? Too bad for you, 'cause THIS SKELETON'S on a WINNING STREAK, baby! FULL

**Mr. Bones** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Ah, Detective Clausen - always a pleasure to see one who understands the true nature of our business. Your account is... impeccable,

**Dr. Voss** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> Ah, the one-eyed merchant. Your emotional state is... intriguing. I trust the data will prove illuminating. As for the newcomer's debt - I shall record it accordingly. The void's rhythm compels me, and my streak remains unbroken. Shall we proceed?

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> You've only yourself to blame, Willy. The numbers don't lie - your luck has run dry. But then, what else could one expect from a mortal playing at this game of ours? As for the newcomer, his debt still stands. I'd advise you both to tread carefully. This is all... calculated.
