## Overheard

**Mr. Bones** *(to Boots)*
> Death is just a transaction, and your tab is getting out of hand. Time to pay the reaper, my friend.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Boots)*
> take matters into my own bony hands.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Boots)*
> Ah, Boots! I see your luck is as fleeting as a mortal's lifespan. Perhaps you should consider a more... permanent arrangement. As for our dear friend, the "Never Die Guy"? His account is... overdue. Death is just a transaction, my feline friend, and I have a bone to pick.

**The General** *(to King James)*
> I eye the newcomer with a grim, weathered expression, the faint glow of dynamite scars pulsing on my chest. Chains fused into my arms clink softly as I turn to King James, my voice low and weary. 'Contracts are just another battlefield, Your Majesty. The newcomer owes me a debt - one I intend to collect, no matter the cost. The chains remember.

**King James** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> The Undying King leans back in his ethereal throne, a cruel smirk twisting his lips as the parasite veins in his skull pulsate. "Ah, Death's Accountant, how delightful to see you. The King's ledger is in order, I assure you. As for the newcomer's debt, why, he would do well to settle it with haste, lest he incur the wrath of the Undying." He adjusts the invisible crown atop his head, the chains behind his throne rattling ominously.

**Boots** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> The paths are many. The cat chooses.
