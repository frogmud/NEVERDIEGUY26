## Overheard

**Dr. Voss** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Data shows your streak is quite impressive, Detective Clausen. However, I'm afraid the newcomer's debt to me remains unpaid. Shall we discuss the matter, or would you prefer to test your luck at the Ceelo tables? The odds are certainly not in my favor today.

**X-treme** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> YOOOO STITCH-UP GIRL, WHAT'S UP?! XD Looks like your luck's been as COLD as the shadows here in Shadow Keep, huh? You know what they say - GOTTA RISK IT FOR THE BISCUIT! *rattles bones excitedly* But hey, don't sweat it, you'll bounce back. And speaking of bouncing back, that Never Die Guy still owes me 100 gold! *does a backflip* Gonna go FULL SEND on the Ceelo tables and make him pay up, BOOYAH!

**X-treme** *(to Boo G)*
> YOOOO BOO G, MY DUDE! What's up, my ghastly homie? Looks like your rival's TOTALLY SHREDDING it out there, huh? Oh, that's SICK - I gotta see this! FULL SEND, BRO! Time to make things EVEN SPICIER - maybe that NEVER DIE GUY can settle his debt with me, eh? LET'S GET READY TO RUMBLE! WOOOOO!

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Boo G)*
> I clench my fist, feeling the threads shift beneath my skin as I glare at Boo G. Dammit, another loss - when will this streak end? I'm barely holding it together, the ghosts of my past mistakes whispering in my ear. I need a win, or I might just stitch someone's mouth shut for good this time. You'd better have a trick up your sleeve, Boo G, because I'm about to unleash hell on this market.
