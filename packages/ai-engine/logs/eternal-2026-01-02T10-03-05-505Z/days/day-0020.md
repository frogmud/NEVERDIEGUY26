**Mr. Bones** *(to Mr. Kevin)*

**Willy One Eye** *(to Keith Man)*
> What have you got

**The General** *(to X-treme)*
> The old days - when every battle was a dance of contracts and blood. Those were the times, my friend. But the newcomer? He's got a knack for escaping the cycle. Owes me a pretty sum, but I'll let him off easy this time. This streak's got me feeling invincible.
