## Overheard

**Mr. Bones** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Your debt is piling up, my friend. Best not let it become...overdue.

**Mr. Bones** *(to The General)*
> The newcomer seems to be quite the lucky one, eh? Guess even the dead can't escape the whims of fate.

**Mr. Bones** *(to The General)*
> Your account is... overdue.

**Mr. Bones** *(to The General)*
> Just wait until he sees the final reckoning.

**Dr. Voss** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> Fascinating. It appears our friend has lost their streak. The data suggests their resilience is... lacking. I'll make a note to study their stress response later. In the meantime, I believe our new acquaintance still owes me a debt. Shall we see if they're feeling lucky today?
