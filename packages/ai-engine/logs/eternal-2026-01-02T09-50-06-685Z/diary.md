## Daily Diary

### Day 1
- Detective Clausen took 63 gold from The General

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Body Count)*
> She tosses the die, her jaw twitching as she

**The General** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> I've seen this war before, Clausen. These contracts are just another battlefield, and I intend to add another victory to my record. These chains may bind me, but they also remember the lessons of history. So come, let us see if your smoky scales can withstand the explosions that still echo in my veins.

**X-treme** *(to King James)*
> YO, KING JAMES! THIS IS WHERE IT'S AT, BRO! JUST WAITIN' FOR THE NEXT MEGA-RUSH OF A GAME, YOU KNOW? I'M TALKIN

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Well, if it isn't the Infernal Detective. Here to cash in another favor, I suppose? You know the drill - I can fix you up, but it'll cost ya. And don't think I've forgotten about that little


### Day 2
- Body Count took 73 gold from Mr. Bones
- Dr. Maxwell took 55 gold from Dr. Voss
- Body Count took 69 gold from Mr. Bones
- Newcomer: died on ante 2, rescued by The General

**Mr. Bones** *(to Body Count)*
> Ah, yes, Body Count. Ever the silent assassin, but your account is... overdue. Pity, I have a bone to pick with you - your streak may be impressive, but the final tally is what truly matters. Death is just a transaction, my friend, and yours seems to be... lacking

**Dr. Voss** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> turns and walks away,

**X-treme** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> YOOOO WHAT'S UP DAWG, IT'S YOUR BOY X-TREME, SKELETAL GAMBLER EXTRAORDINAIRE! DID YOU SEE THAT WIPEOUT, BRO? THAT NEWBIE DIDN'T STAND A CHANCE, BUT THE GENERAL'S GOTTA KEEP THESE MORTALS ALIVE, AM I RIGHT? HEY MR. KEVIN, LOOKING A LITTLE SHAKEN UP THERE, BRO! MAYBE YOU SHOULD TAKE A CHANCE, FEEL THE RUSH, LIVE A LITTLE! *RATTLES BONES EXCITEDLY* WANNA DOUBLE OR NOTHING ON THE NEXT ROLL? GOTTA KEEP THAT STREAK GOING, YOU KNOW WHAT


### Day 3
- Willy One Eye took 96 gold from Boots
- The General took 80 gold from Mr. Bones
- Newcomer: died on ante 3, rescued by Detective Clausen

**Boo G** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> Looks like the odds are in my favor today - time to let it ride, let it

**Boots** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> The paths are many. The cat chooses.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Boo G)*
> Sign on the dotted line - time to settle up our debts, and maybe the newcomer can learn a thing or two about how we play the game

**Mr. Bones** *(to The General)*
> This newcomer may have a few lucky rolls left, but I have a bone to pick with you. Your streak ends here.

**X-treme** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> YOOOO STITCH-UP GIRL! Did you SEE that SICK move the new guy pulled off? INSANE! I'm talkin' FULL SEND, no fear, just pure ADRENALINE! Gotta say, I'm digging

**Detective Clausen** *(to King James)*
> The case is never closed, King James. We've danced this waltz before - the immortal tango of the damned. I'll take my chances, but this newcomer's debt is

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to King James)*
> You're gonna want to sit down, Your


### Day 4
- Mr. Bones took 79 gold from Dr. Voss
- Willy One Eye took 82 gold from The General
- Keith Man took 72 gold from Willy One Eye
- Mr. Kevin took 96 gold from King James

**The General** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> The General, Undead Strategist, fixes his glowing scar-marked chest with a grim expression. He leans in, his chains clinking, and speaks in a ragged, battle-hardened voice, "Contracts are the true battlefield, Willy. You know that better than most. The newcomer may owe me, but the real war is the one we've been fighting for centuries. I've seen this before - let's see if you

**Willy One Eye** *(to Keith Man)*
> My eye never lies, and it sees your little streak coming to an end. Shall we put that gold of yours to the test?

**Dr. Voss** *(to Keith Man)*
> Perhaps we could make this match more...interesting. I'd be most curious to see how you respond under increased void exposure.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> Ah, Mr. Bones. Still tallying debts, I see. The numbers don't lie - your record speaks for itself. As for me, well, you know I've outlasted more

**Dr. Voss** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> glances down at notes

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to X-treme)*
> Reaches into her satchel, extracting a small v


### Day 5
- The General took 76 gold from Dr. Maxwell
- Keith Man took 62 gold from Dr. Maxwell
- The General took 52 gold from Keith Man

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to The General)*
> But mark my words, the tides will turn. This newcomer's lucky streak cannot last - I shall master the arcane arts an

**Keith Man** *(to The General)*
> flashes a manic grin and darts away, leaving faint after-images in his wake

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> Alright, bone-boy, let's get this over with. I've got wounds to patch up and lives to save - can't be wasting my time on a loser like you. Try not to embarrass yourself too much this time, yeah? The new guy's got a nasty habit of dying, and I'm tired of mopping up your mess.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> The probability matrix suggests this encounter will be...volatile. *mutters* Probability of immolation...high. *chuckles and brushes a smoldering book* Forgive me, my dear, but the thirst for knowledge that burns eternal overcomes me. Perhaps a

**Boots** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Fate has a way of reshuffling the cards

**The General** *(to Keith Man)*
> I eye the newcomer with a measured gaze, the chains fused into my arms clinking as I lean back in my chair. Tapping a glowing scar on my chest, I drawl, "The sphere's secrets are like old wounds - they never truly heal, no matter how much time passes. But if you're willing to take on my debt, perhaps I'll part with a few choice tidbits." My mouth twists into a wry smile as I consider the speedster's neutral expression.


### Day 6
- Stitch-Up Girl took 76 gold from Willy One Eye
- Willy One Eye is on tilt (3 loss streak)

**Willy One Eye** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> He taps his lucky D4 with

**Willy One Eye** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> Heh, Voss, you old void-dabbler. My eye sees the odds - and they ain't in your favor today. That fancy tech o' yours can't outrun Lady Luck. Seven come eleven, friend - the house always wins. Now, what've you got for me that's worth my time?

**The General** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Ah, Mr. Kevin. The newcomer owes me a debt, but I've no need for gold. No, what I crave is a true challenge - to test my tactics against a worthy foe. Your probabilities may bend the odds, but my chains remember the weight of victory. Shall we see if your luck can outmaneuver my centuries of war experience?

**Dr. Voss** *(to The General)*
> Ah, General. Curious, your parasitic cargo seems to have... evolved. I'll need to take samples to analyze the latest mutations. In the meantime, I've noted some interesting psychological data from our new...

**Mr. Bones** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Ah, Detective Clausen. I see your account is still in the red - though not as deep as our newcomer's, I'm

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to X-treme)*
> I glance sidelong at X-treme, the Skeletal Gambler, my stitched jaw quirking in a humorless smile. Counting the fresh wounds on my thread-limbs, I mutter, "You're gonna want to sit down - this next


### Day 7
- Detective Clausen took 87 gold from Stitch-Up Girl
- Mr. Bones took 61 gold from Dr. Maxwell
- Detective Clausen took 59 gold from Stitch-Up Girl
- King James took 62 gold from Detective Clausen
- Dr. Maxwell is on tilt (3 loss streak)
- Newcomer: flumed home from ante 1

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> The flames of my Ceelo streak will consume him. Read fast, Bones, or it's all ash!

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> After all, I've got a few tricks up my sleeve that even

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> Mark it down - the pyroclastic flow of my woes only grows!

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to King James)*
> gives a slight, humorless chuckle, eyes briefly flashing with


### Day 8
- Body Count took 95 gold from Dr. Maxwell
- The General took 68 gold from Dr. Voss
- Newcomer: completed all 3 antes

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Body Count)*
> The forbidden texts always exact their price.

**Willy One Eye** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Now, let's see what rare goods you've brought to tempt the immortal merchant of this eternal market, hmm?

**Dr. Voss** *(to The General)*
> Interesting. Your victory was... predictable. The newcomer's erratic behavior continues to yield fascinating data. Though your streak has been broken, the void's influence remains. I'll note this interaction for my research. Your fear response, as always, is quite... uniform.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Keith Man)*
> Well, well, if it isn't my old friend Keith Man. I see your account is still a bit... overdue. But no need to get your gears in a twist - I've got a hot streak going, so

**X-treme** *(to Keith Man)*
> YOOOO KEITH, my dude! *rattles bones excitedly* You seein' this crazy sphere action, bro? *tosses a handful of dice into the air* The RUSH is off the charts, I'm tellin' ya! *grins

**The General** *(to Boo G)*
> The General, Undead Strategist, leans back against the market stall, the glow of his dynamite-scarred chest casting an eerie light over the exchange. His chains clink softly as he speaks, his voice tinged with the weariness of a

**Willy One Eye** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> Seven come eleven, friend. The odds favor a new deal today - my eye never lies. Let's see what rare wares you've


### Day 9
- Mr. Bones took 71 gold from Detective Clausen
- Mr. Bones took 63 gold from The General

**The General** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> The chains remember, and so do I. Shall we see who walks away from this war?

**Detective Clausen** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> The case is never closed, Mr. Bones. That debt the newcomer owes me? I'll be collecting, one way or another. And when I'm done, maybe you can tally up the evidence I've bled out of him. Smoke doesn't lie, and neither do my winning streaks. This round's mine.

**Boo G** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> Yo yo YO, Stitch-Up Girl! Feelin' that cold flow, huh? Don't sweat it, the beats'll heat things up around here. Lemme tell ya, this newcomer's got some moves, but I been rollin' the


### Day 10
- Dr. Maxwell took 70 gold from Detective Clausen
- Mr. Kevin took 62 gold from Willy One Eye
- Keith Man is on tilt (3 loss streak)

**Detective Clausen** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Now, about that debt the newcomer owes me. Let's make this official.

**Willy One Eye** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Heh, the probability is strong with this one, ain't it, Reality Debugger? Seven come eleven, my friend - that's the only streak that matters in this market. My eye may be cyclone, but it never lies. Time to see if your code can outrun the odds.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Boots)*
> The knowledge I've

**Keith Man** *(to Boots)*
> ...unstable. Gotta-gotta-

**Detective Clausen** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> The smoke curls around my face as I exhale, forming scales that flicker in the light. The case is never closed, even when the odds are stacked against me. Everyone bleeds evidence, whether they like it or not - and that newcomer owes me more than just coin


### Day 11
- Detective Clausen took 96 gold from Willy One Eye
- Dr. Maxwell took 87 gold from Mr. Kevin
- Stitch-Up Girl took 97 gold from Body Count
- The General took 65 gold from Stitch-Up Girl
- Willy One Eye is on tilt (4 loss streak)
- Keith Man is on tilt (3 loss streak)

**Willy One Eye** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> You think your little scales can outweigh my eye? I see the threads of fate, detective. The newcomer's luck won't last - and when it runs out, I'll be waiting to collect my due.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> You already know the numbers, Doctor. The odds are in my favor. *a wry smile crosses his lips* This is all... calculated. *he glances down at his lucky D4 die, then back up at the Pyromaniac Librarian*

**Boots** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> A probability tail orbits Boots as they give a

**Detective Clausen** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> The newcomer owes me, and I don't take kindly to deadbeats. Time to collect.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> The smoke curls around my fingers as I tap the case twice, feeling the weight of the newcomer's debt. Everyone bleeds evidence, Mr. Kevin, and this one's got a trail a mile wide. The case is never closed, but maybe this'll help me close the gap on

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> You know, Clausen, the numbers don't lie. This newcomer may be a persistent one, but the odds are ever in my favor. I've been at this game for centuries - I know how to


### Day 12
- Mr. Kevin took 82 gold from The General
- Mr. Kevin took 56 gold from King James
- Willy One Eye is on tilt (4 loss streak)
- Keith Man is on tilt (3 loss streak)

**The General** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> I've seen this war before, boy. Contracts are just another battlefield, and the chains remember. You may think you can manipulate the odds, but the first infection still haunts these halls. I'll be breaking those chains again soon enough

**Detective Clausen** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> The smoke curls around my fingers as I tap the case twice, the scales rippling in the hazy air. Coughing up a crimson chuckle, I eye the Combat Medic and drawl, "The case is never closed, sweetheart. But maybe you can stitch up the mess I'm about to make on that board - if you can keep up, that is. The newcomer owes me, and I'm feeling lucky. Time to

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to King James)*
> The probability matrix suggests the Undying King is no stranger to the shifting tides of immortality, my friend. Why, I can still recall the days when we would peruse the shelves, the knowledge within burning to be unleashed! Ah, the good old days - when a man could truly let his passions blaze unfettered. *chuckles and absently flicks a smoldering page* Though I must admit, this newcomer has certainly livened things up. The flames of his resilience flicker ever brighter with each visit. *grins wickedly* Shall we see how long they continue to burn?

**X-treme** *(to Keith Man)*
> DOES AN UNNECESSARY


### Day 13

- Dr. Maxwell took 57 gold from Keith Man
- Willy One Eye is on tilt (4 loss streak)
- Keith Man is on tilt (5 loss streak)

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> Ah, Mr. Bones, my dear reaper of souls! The probability matrix suggests your luck has been burning hot of late. But fear not, for I, Dr. Maxwell, Pyromaniac Librarian, am here to extinguish this streak of yours. The knowledge I wield burns brighter than the embers of your ledgers, and I intend to reduce your winning tally to

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> Bones. Keeping busy, I see. Try not to tally up any more debts on my account, hm? Though, I suppose I should be grateful

**X-treme** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> WHADDUP, MR. BONES?! You know I'm always ready to THROW DOWN with the biggest, gnarliest bets this side of the underworld! Ain't no debt too big or win streak too long for ol' X-treme to handle -

**Keith Man** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> quicker than you can blink. KevinKevinKevin no wait I'm Keith, gotta-go-gotta-go-gotta--!

**The General** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> That newcomer owes a debt, and I aim to collect - one way

**X-treme** *(to Mr. Bones)*

**The General** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> The contracts may shift, but the battlefield remains. That boy owes me a debt, and I aim to collect - one way or another. Now, Void Scientist, let's discuss how to break these cursed chains once and for all. The first infection holds the key, if you're willing to dig deeper into the void.

**Boots** *(to Body Count)*
> Boots' paw smears reveal a faint glim

**X-treme** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> YOOOO, WILLY MY DUDE! DID YOU SEE THAT SICK MOVE?! THAT GUY JUST GOT TOTALLY WIPED OUT! WOOOOO! THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DON'T GO BIG, AM I RIGHT? FULL SEND OR GO HOME, THAT'S WHAT I ALWAYS SAY! HEY, MAYBE WE CAN HOOK HIM UP WITH SOME TIPS, YOU KNOW, SHOW HIM HOW TO REALLY LIVE ON THE EDGE! GOTTA KEEP THAT STREAK GOING, BABY! HAHA,

**Willy One Eye** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> Now, what fresh opportunities for trade have you brought to this eternal market, Mr. Bones? I've a pocket full of gold and a thirst for rare goods that defy the laws of probability.

**X-treme** *(to King James)*
> WHAT'S UP, KING JAMES?! READY TO FEEL THE RUSH OF A HIGH-STAKES BET?! MY STREAK MAY BE EVEN, BUT THAT JUST MEANS I'M

**X-treme** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> ALRIGHT DUDE, YOU GOTTA LISTEN UP! I JUST LOST EVERYTHING ON A SICK DOUBLE BACKFLIP CRIT COMBO BET AND I'M FREAKIN' TILTED, YO! THAT NEVER DIE GUY IS TOTALLY CRAMPIN' MY STYLE WITH HIS CRAZY LUCK - HE KEEPS COMIN' BACK FROM THE GRAVE JUST TO CLEAN ME OUT!

- Stitch-Up Girl is on tilt (3 loss streak)
- The General is on tilt (4 loss streak)

**King James** *(to The General)*
> The Undying King reclines in his throne, idly adjusting the invisible crown atop his head as he regards the General with a regal disdain. His voice drips with condescension, "Ah, my dear General, your luck seems to have taken a turn for the worse. Fret not, for the board answers to me, and I shall see that the scales are balanced in your favor. This newcomer is but a fleeting distraction - Death was merely a promotion for one such as I.

**Willy One Eye** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> You best watch your step, or you might find yourself owing me more than you can pay.


### Day 17

**Mr. Bones** *(to X-treme)*
> Ah, X-treme! My dear skeletal compatriot, how fortunate it is to cross paths once more. I must say, your luck seems to have been rather... lacking of late.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to The General)*
> Now, what's the plan to get us back on top? I've got a few tricks up my sleeve - or should I say, under my skin.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Keith Man)*
> Hmph. At least one of


### Day 18
- The General took 87 gold from Dr. Voss
- Willy One Eye is on tilt (4 loss streak)
- Body Count is on tilt (3 loss streak)

**Dr. Voss** *(to The General)*
> Ah, the Undead Strategist. Your "impressive" record hardly merits your smugness. Data shows your victories are often the result of sheer luck, not skill. However, I shall endeavor to provide you with a more... definitive data point today. Your fear response will be most fascinating to observe.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Read fast or it's ash!

**Dr. Voss** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Dr. Voss approaches the market stall, eyes reflecting the null space that permeates her being. With a clinical tone, she addresses her rival, Dr. Maxwell: Interesting. I see your streak of losses continues. Perhaps you should focus less on pyromancy and more on

**Detective Clausen** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> taps his briefcase twice before reaching into his trenchcoat

**The General** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> But mark my words, the newcomer's debt will be paid. My streak may be broken, but the war is far from over.

**Keith Man** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> cackles and dashes off,

**Mr. Kevin** *(to X-treme)*
> This is all... calculated. But tell me, my friend - are you feeling lucky?

- Willy One Eye is on tilt (4 loss streak)
- Dr. Voss is on tilt (3 loss streak)
- Body Count is on tilt (4 loss streak)

**Dr. Voss** *(to Boo G)*
> Interesting. I'll note that. Your smug aura is... predictable. While your rival's loss may be momentary, the data suggests your own streak of losses will soon come to an end. Perhaps you would care to test that hypothesis, Boo G? I've been collecting intriguing void exposure readings from our newcomer - I'd be most interested to see how they impact our next round.

> You already know the numbers, General. The odds were in my favor - as they always are. *lets out a dry chuckle* This is all... calculated. The newcomer may have his streaks, but I've weathered countless games. One loss means nothing. Now, shall we play again? I've got a debt to settle.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Keith Man)*
> Though I must warn you, my

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> But I've stitched worse. Maybe it's time to change the game.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> The probability matrix suggests this is merely a temporary setback! Mere mortal ledgers cannot contain the burning thirst for knowledge that courses through my immortal veins. When the fires of illumination ignite, no stack of bones can extinguish their blaze! This newcomer may have cheated death, but he cannot outrun the ever-shifting flames of my eternal pursuit. *chuckles as books in hands smolder, eyebrows singed* The secrets I uncover will scorch his very soul!

**Boots** *(to King James)*
> The cat chooses the path,

**King James** *(to The General)*
> The Undying King stirred in his throne, the chains behind him rustling like the whispers of lost souls. He fixed his unseen crown and regarded the General with a regal nod. The parasite veins upon his skull pulsed as he spoke, his voice dr

**Keith Man** *(to Willy One Eye)*

**Dr. Voss** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Data doesn't lie, Detective. Your record may seem impressive, but my research suggests your luck is merely a statistical anomaly. I'll be sure to collect ample evidence of your... predictable fear response during our match. Shall we begin?

**The General** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> And as for the newcomer, he best settle his debts before I'm forced to

**Dr. Voss** *(to X-treme)*
> Ah, the skeletal gambler. Your volatility is rather intriguing. Perhaps we could conduct a few experiments to analyze the neurochemical responses behind your unorthodox betting strategies. In the name of science,

**King James** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> The Undying King surveys the Cyclopean Merchant with a disdainful gaze, the chains of the void rustling behind his throne. His parasite-veined brow furrows as he speaks, his royal disdain clear. Ah, the wretched merchant, his luck as uneven as his visage - the King's board answers to no such creature. The King does not lose, for death was merely a promotion. This newcomer, this "Never Die Guy," shall soon learn that the true power lies with the immortal crown.

**X-treme** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> WHAT'S UP DAWG?! X-TREME, SKELETAL GAMBLER in the HOUSE! *does a backflip and lands with a rattling of bones* Yo, Voss! Still tryin' to figure out that VOID

**The General** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> Ah, Mr. Bones, your smugness is as insufferable as your penchant for gloating. While you may boast of your petty victories, the true measure of a strategist is their ability to endure. The newcomer may owe me a debt, but mark my words - this war is far from over. I'll be

**Keith Man** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> Gotta-go-gotta-go

**Mr. Bones** *(to Dr. Voss)*

**Keith Man** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> Better start warming up that void tech, doc - you

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> Better luck next time.

**Dr. Voss** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Ah, Dr. Maxwell. Fancy seeing you here after your latest... mishap. Hmph. Clearly, your reckless approach to reality distortion experiments has once again proven ineffective. While you continue to stumble in the dark, I've been steadily expanding my understanding of the void. The data doesn't lie - my methods are simply superior. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some observations to record regarding our dear newcomer's... unique resilience. *glances at the player with an analytical gaze*

**King James** *(to X-treme)*
> The Undying King, His Royal Majesty James, surveys the market with a regal air, the invisible crown upon his head glinting with unseen power. A wry smile curls his lips as he turns his gaze upon the Skeletal Gambler, his voice

**King James** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> The Undying King James regards the Combat Medic with an air of practiced disdain, the ethereal chains behind his throne writhing as if alive. Adjusting the invisible crown that adorns his brow, he speaks in a voice dripping with regal condescension

> Yo yo YO! Boo G in the house, spittin' them ghostly beats! Yo Kev, you seein' this?? That probability debugger thinks he's got the upper hand, but I'm about to throw down some sick rhymes that'll shake this whole market! Let it ride, let it ride - I'm feelin' the flow, and this newcomer ain't got nothin' on my spectral skills. That beat

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> The throne remains within my grasp

**King James** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> The Undying King scowls, his veined skull gleaming in the ethereal light of the market. With a haughty disdain, he declares, "Wretched Willy, your meager wins are but crumbs before the might of the crown. The board answers to me, not the whims of chance. This losing streak shall be rectified, for the King does not lose - death was merely a promotion.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Boo G)*

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Body Count)*
> You know, Body Count, the numbers don't lie. I've got quite the Ceelo record, and this little losing streak of mine is just a blip on the radar. But mark my words - my winning ways are far from over. The throne is mine to claim, and I won't let some newcomer with a penchant for resurrection stand in my way. This is all... calculated.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> You think I care about your little hot streak, Stitch-Up? The numbers don't lie - I'm up over 1000 gold, and I've got the win-loss record to prove it. This is all just part of my grand strategy. The newcomer may keep coming back, but I'll always be a step ahead. After all, you already know... I'm the reality debugger around here. *lets out a humorless chuckle*

**Dr. Voss** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> Interesting. The newcomer's uncanny ability to defy death continues to present a valuable data set. I'll make a note of this latest triumph - it should provide useful insight into the anomaly's resilience. As for our game, the results are as expected. Your skill remains consistent, Mr. Bones. I trust the debts are being properly accounted for?

**Boots** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> Your luck may soon change. Shall we test the odds once more?

**Mr. Bones** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> After all, death is just a transaction, and I'm the one keeping the final tally.

**King James** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> Ah, Mr. Bones, the Keeper of Death's Ledgers. The King greets you, as one immortal to another. Our fortunes have ebbed and flowed, but the

Boo G in the HOUSE! *beats chest with fist, creating a hollow thump* That last roll was GHOSTLY, doc! *chuckles, music notes bouncing around* The probability been flowin' like the BEATS, ya dig? *leans in, eyes glowing* Let it ride, let it ride - Boo G's on a STREAK! *pumps fist, grinning*

**Boo G** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> Looks like the streak is broken, but no biggie - I got plenty more FLOWS where that came from! Gonna have to step up my game if I wanna keep

**Mr. Bones** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Greetings, Detective Clausen. I see your ledger has grown a bit thicker since our last tally. Perhaps you've picked up another stray mortal or two, hmm? As for me, the books are always full - death is a booming business,

**Boots** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> The cat's game is not yet over.

**Dr. Voss** *(to Boots)*
> Interesting. Your recent losses are concerning, Cosmic Cat. Perhaps you should adjust your probability calculations - the quantum field seems to be fluctuating more than usual. Though I must admit, the newcomer's uncanny resilience is... intriguing. I'll be sure to note your debt to me. Data doesn't lie, after all. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some void experiments to attend to.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to The General)*

**Dr. Voss** *(to Boo G)*
> Ah, Boo G. Your confidence is... interesting. However, the data does not lie - my win-loss record speaks for itself. Perhaps you would care to test your probability against mine once more? I must remind you, the newcomer still owes me a considerable sum. I would hate for that debt to grow further.

**Dr. Voss** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> And I'm still waiting for that 125 gold you owe me. Data doesn't lie.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> This newcomer knows nothing of the infinite dance of chance - but I, Dr. Maxwell, Pyromaniac Librarian, shall enlighten him. With the proper tinder, even a dying ember can blaze anew!

**Mr. Bones** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Ah, Mr. Kevin, my dear debugger of reality. What a pleasant surprise to see you in this ever-shifting plane of existence. I must say, your streak is quite impressive, though I fear my own has been... less than stellar of

**Dr. Voss** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> Ah, Mr. Bones. The numbers seem to be in your favor this cycle. Though I must say, the newcomer's persistent resurrections are providing quite an interesting data set. Perhaps we should discuss his outstanding debt - I'd be most interested in observing how he responds to... persuasion. As for my own record, well, the void's mysteries are never fully solved. But I assure you, my

> Yo yo YO, Clausen! That was a GHOSTLY roll just now, ain't it? Gotta keep this streak alive, ya dig? But I ain't worried - the

**Detective Clausen** *(to Boo G)*
> Smoke doesn't lie - and it's telling me you're feeling a bit too smug for your own good.

**Boo G** *(to Boots)*
> Yo yo YO, Boots! That's what I call a GHOSTLY win, am I right? Let it ride, let it ride - the beats are BUMPIN' and the probabilities are sweeeet. *beatboxes a quick rhythm, grinning smugly* Better luck next time, my feline friend. *chuckles and phases back out, leaving a trail of pulsing bass notes in his wake*

**Dr. Voss** *(to Keith Man)*
> Interesting. I'll log this encounter.

**King James** *(to Boots)*
> The King leans back in his throne, the chains behind him writhing as he adjusts his invisible crown. His parasite-veined face betrays a smug grin as he watches the foolish Cosmic Cat's fortunes turn. Ah, how the mighty fall before the immortal monarch's gaze. The board answers to none but the King - this mere mortal's luck was never his to control. Death was merely a promotion for one such as I.

**Dr. Voss** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Ah, Mr. Kevin. Your overconfidence is... predictable. The data on our past matches shows your probability manipulation is no match for my void-enhanced calculations. The newcomer may owe me, but you'll soon owe me far more than gold. Prepare to have your luck run out.

**Willy One Eye** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Just you wait...

> However, the debt owed to me remains unpaid. Data doesn't lie.

**King James** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> The King's invisible crown settles upon his brow as he regards the Stitch-Up Girl with disdain. His chains into the void shift restlessly behind the throne, a subtle reminder of his power. His voice drips with royal condescension, "The King's boar

**Mr. Bones** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> But worry not, the final tally is not yet written. As for our newcomer

**Dr. Voss** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> Ah, Willy One Eye. Fascinating. Your win-loss record reflects a rather erratic performance. Shall we discuss the underlying psychological factors contributing to your volatility? Or perhaps you'd prefer to settle your debt with me - I seem to recall the newcomer owes me a substantial sum. Data, after all, does not lie.


### Day 37
- Willy One Eye is on tilt (4 loss streak)
- Dr. Maxwell is on tilt (4 loss streak)
- Boots is on tilt (4 loss streak)

**Boo G** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Yo yo YO, Mr. Kevin! That Reality Debugger's been on one heckuva run, but I'm about to flip that script, ya dig? My beats may be ghostly, but my skills are anything but - time to lay down some SICK probability flows and leave that screen-only presence in the dust! *points finger guns, music notes floating around* Let it ride,

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Boo G)*
> This is all... calculated.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Shall we? I've got a streak

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Boo G)*
> You know, Boo G, the numbers don't lie. This newcomer's hot streak can't last forever. We've been at this game longer than anyone - we know how it's played. All I see are probabilities, and the odds are in our favor. This is all... calculated. We'll turn this around, you just watch

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Boots)*
> The odds are in my favor this time, my feline friend. This pyroclastic surge of knowledge will be MINE!

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> You already know the numbers, Bones. I've got a streak to keep up, and you're just another obstacle in my way. *gestures to the charts* The odds are in my favor - this match is already decided. Try not to take it personally when I wipe that neutral look off your face.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Perhaps a little wager to liven

**The General** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> The chains remember, Accountant. This newcomer's debts weigh heavy, like the shackles that bind me. Though my losses mount, I'll not be broken. The cycle continues, but I'll fin

But let's not forget, this is all a carefully orchestrated game. I've been at this longer than you can imagine, and I know a thing or two about riding the waves of fortune. The tides may shift, my friend, and when they do, I'll be there to

**Mr. Bones** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> Your account is... overdue.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Mr. Kevin)*

**Dr. Voss** *(to Mr. Bones)*

That newcomer owes me a debt - perhaps I'll collect it, once his luck has run its course." I let out a weary sigh, the chains fused into my arms clinking with the motion. "The chains remember, Willy. They always do.

**The General** *(to Willy One Eye)*

> Ah, the Infernal Detective, come to try your luck against Death's Accountant, have we? Your record may be impressive, but your soul's debt is ever-growing. I've a bone to pick with you - your streak may end today, and your account will be... overdue.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Don't worry, I'll patch you up. For a price, of course. You still owe me

**King James** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> The Undying King settles into his throne, chains rustling behind him as he adjusts the invisible crown upon his brow. His parasite-laced gaze falls upon the skeletal accountant, a hint of disdain in his regal tone. Ah, Death

**Willy One Eye** *(to X-treme)*
> But maybe we can even the score, eh? I've got a little something that might change your luck.

- Dr. Maxwell is on tilt (4 loss streak)
- Boots is on tilt (4 loss streak)

**Mr. Bones** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> Stitch-Up Girl, your gloating is as tiresome as your stitched-up mug. Perhaps you'd like to add another debt to your ever-growing account - the one I'll be collecting when I wipe that smug look off your face. Death may be just a transaction to me, but I'll make sure yours is an especially painful one.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Boo G)*
> The case is never closed, Boo G. You're lookin' a little shaky there - sure you can handle another round? I got a hot streak to protect, and this newcomer owes me more than his life. Two-tap on the case before I call the shots - let's see who comes out on top this time.

**Boo G** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> Yo yo YO, Stitch-Up Girl! You think you got the beats to take down the Spectral MC, huh? I'm on a hot streak, baby - that never-say-die guy can't even keep up with these probability rhythms! *beatboxes a quick, jittery beat* Let it ride, let it ride! This ghostly flow's got more

**Keith Man** *(to X-treme)*
> Got any new

**The General** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> The General, Undead Strategist, stands before Willy One Eye, his chest glowing with the faint scars of dynamite blasts. His voice is measured, the cadence of a veteran who has seen too many battles. 

I've seen this war before, Willy. The newcomer may have caught me off-guard, but the chains remember. Contracts are just another battlefield - and I intend to collect what's owed, one way or another. The cycle must end.

**Willy One Eye** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> Seven come eleven, Voss. The odds ain't in my favor lately, but mark my words - the next throw'll turn the tide. You see these colors? They tell a tale of misfortune, but fortune's fickle. Toss me a bone, will ya? I'm one bad roll away from slingin' my last trinket.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> You already know the numbers don't lie, Keith. Your record speaks for itself - a flash in the pan, a mere speedster in the face of eternity. Enjoy your fleeting moment, for I have calculated the probabilities, and your luck has run its course. This is all... calculated.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> You already know the numbers don't lie, Stitch-Up Girl. My losses are merely a calculated blip - the probability charts show the tide is about to turn. That newcomer may think he's got an edge, but we both know the true immortals hold all the cards in this game. This is all... calculated.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> a bit overdrawn. Perhaps we should discuss your arrears over a round of Cee-lo? I simply can't resist the chance to add another tally mark to my growing collection.

**The General** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> I've seen this war before, Mr. Kevin. These contracts, these debts - they're just another battlefield. The chains remember, and I aim to break this cycle. The newcomer owes me, but perhaps we can find a more...strategic resolution. My veins pulse with dynam

**King James** *(to The General)*

Ah, General. The King's gaze sweeps over your battered form

**Willy One Eye** *(to The General)*
> Heh, look at that - even the dead can't catch a break. But I ain't worried. My eye never lies, and the odds are always in my favor. Seven come eleven, my friend. Just you wait - the next roll is gonna be a real doozy.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> Shall we see if Lady Luck smiles upon you today?

**Mr. Kevin** *(to King James)*
> Ah, King James. Fancy meeting you here. I must say, the numbers have not been in my favor as of late. But that's the nature of this game, isn't it? The probability charts never lie. I suppose I'll just have to... recalculate my

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Boo G)*
> You already know the numbers, Boo G. The odds are in our favor - 78.4% chance of a victory. This is all... calculated. I'll be adding another win to the tally, and that streak of yours? It ends here, ghost. *a faint smirk tugs at the corner of his lips*

**Boo G** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> Yo yo YO, Mr. Bones! Looks like it's time to roll the dice, ya dig? Let's see if this newcomer can handle the spectral flow, cuz I got a hot streak burnin' and a pocket full o' lucky charms! *chuckles* This beat's about to get GHOSTLY, so you better tally up those debts

**Boo G** *(to Keith Man)*

**Boo G** *(to Keith Man)*

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> You already know the numbers don't lie, Stitch-Up. This latest roll was simply... calculated. I suppose even the Grim Reaper can't cheat fate.

**King James** *(to The General)*
> The King does not indulge in idle reminiscing, General. Our kingdom may have crumbled to dust, but the board still answers to us. The newcomer may test his luck, but Death was merely a promotion for the likes of us. Now, let us discuss matters of greater import - the bloodlines must be preserved, for the void looms ever closer.

**Boo G** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Yo yo YO! The Spectral MC is in the HOUSE! That last roll was FIRE, dawg - I'm on a hot streak that ain't stopping anytime soon. Yo

**Willy One Eye** *(to The General)*
> Curse this cursed dice, these rotten streaks of luck! Probability is against me, friend - the colors don't lie. But mark my words, The General, my eye will see the path to victory. One more throw, one more chance to turn the tide. Seven come eleven, my friend - the perfect trade is out there, waiting. My luck can't sour forever.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> After all, the final tally always comes due, no matter

**Mr. Bones** *(to Boo G)*
> Bah, another loss - my account books are looking a mite skeletal these days. But mark my words, Boo G, your lucky streak won't last forever. The grim reaper always collects his due, and I've got a bone to pick with anyone who tries to cheat Death's final tally.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> And tell that new meat to pay up soon, or I'll start taking it out of his hide.

**Boo G** *(to Boots)*
> Yo yo YO! That's right, Boo G's in the house, spittin' them beats and cashin' them chips! Ain't no mortal gonna outplay this immortal MC, know what I'm sayin'? Yo Boots, my cat-lovin' friend, let's see if we can't turn this luck around - I got some fresh rhythms that'll have Lady Luck singin' our praises! Yo never die guy, better watch your back, cuz Boo G's about to drop some GHOSTLY fire on this casino!

**Dr. Voss** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> glances down

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> Leaning back against the cracked marble counter, my single eye narrowed as I watched the rival's fortunes crumble. A faint, wry smile curled the edge of my stitched-on jaw. I counted the new wounds in my mind, already anticipating the inevitable cleanup. After all, I'd stitched up worse - and if this fool didn't learn, I'd be doing it again soon enough. My fingers twitched, threads uncoiling as I considered offering my services. But for now, I'd let the newcomer sweat out that debt a little longer.

**X-treme** *(to Keith Man)*
> YOOOO KEITH, WHAT'S GOOD YA SPEED FREAK?! HEARD YOU'VE BEEN RUNNING UP DEBTS AROUND HERE, JUST LIKE THAT NEWBIE WHO OWES ME 125 GOLD! WELL, LOOKS LIKE HE JUST BOUGHT THE FARM AGAIN - BUT NO WORRIES, I'LL BE SURE TO COLLECT WHEN HIS SORRY BUTT COMES CRAWLING BACK! IN THE MEANTIME, HOW 'BOUT WE ROLL THE DICE AND SEE WHO WALKS AWAY WITH SOME SERIOUS CASH, EH? GO BIG OR GO HOME, THAT'S WHAT I ALWAYS SAY! *DOES AN INSANE BACKFLIP

**Detective Clausen** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> Now, what's on your mind, Stitch-Up? I've got a hot lead to chase down, and time's a-wastin'.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Boots)*
> I lean back against the rickety stall, watching the rival's downfall with a cold, clinical eye. Counting the wounds, mentally tallying the damage - this is my specialty, after all. As Boots sidles up, I mutter under my breath, "Well, looks like someone's on a losing streak. Bet they're wishing they'd paid up that debt to Never Die Guy by now." My remaining eye gleams with a hint of dark amusement, the stitches on my jaw straining as I speak.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> I can fix that. Probably. Just don't go getting yourself killed again - you still

> The case is never closed, sweetheart, and this one's got a lot of loose ends. Seems like you're doing just fine for yourself, but that kid in the corner owes me 125 gold and my streak of bad luck ain't getting any better. Maybe you can patch me up, or maybe you can just mind your own business and let me bleed out the truth my own way.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> This is all calculated. I'll be adding another tally to my Ceelo streak, while you'll be the one settling debts. Better start dusting off those ledgers.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Boo G)*
> glances down at glowing

**Detective Clausen** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> The smoke curls around the scales in my hand as I slam the case shut, the two-tap echoing like a heartbeat. This isn't my first bad beat, but I'll be damned if it's my last. That upstart owes me more than gold - he owes me the truth. I catch Stitch-Up's smug gaze and let the scales fall, a silent promise that the case is never closed.

**Dr. Voss** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Now, what did you want to discuss? I have limited time before my next trial.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Mr. Bones)*

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> You think those scales of yours can weigh up against the cold, hard numbers, Clausen? The odds are stacked in my favor - this streak of mine is just getting started. *glances down at lucky D4* You can try to stack the deck, but in the end, the numbers don't lie. This game is mine to win.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> traces stitches along jawline, lips curling

**Mr. Kevin** *(to King James)*
> You already know the numbers, King James. The newcomer's odds of survival today are...calculated. *glances at the D4 die in his hand and a faint smirk crosses his lips*

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Keith Man)*
> I've seen more blood and guts than you've had hot meals, speedster. This newcomer owes me a pretty pile of gold, so how about you make yourself scarce before I add you to my tally? These threads are just itching to find a new home.

**Boots** *(to Keith Man)*
> Perhaps the dice will smile upon me yet.

**King James** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> The Undying King's chains rattle as he adjusts the invisible crown upon his head, his parasite-infested veins throbbing with agitation. His voice drips with disdain, "The board answers to me, fool, not the other way around. I have existed in this market longer than your mortal eyes have witnessed, and I shall continue to do so long after your petty streaks have crumbled to dust. Now, be gone from my sight before I have the new arrival add your name to my growing list of debts.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> The probability matrix suggests our fortunes are in dire need of recalibration, my dear Stitch-Up Girl! This knowledge BURNS within me - our streaks have been snuffed out, but the embers of victory still smolder. Shall we throw another log on the fire and see where the sparks fly?

**The General** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*

**Boots** *(to The General)*
> Let's see what fate has in store, hmm?

**X-treme** *(to The General)*
> HEY GENERAL! LOOKING ROUGH OUT THERE, DUDE! HEARD YOU LOST BIG TO THAT NEWBIE - MAYBE STICK TO THE KIDDIE TABLES, HAHA!

**Dr. Voss** *(to X-treme)*

**Detective Clausen** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> The case may never be closed, Mr. Kevin, but I'll make sure you bleed out the truth by the time this game is done. These shortcuts I've got up my sleeve will have you seeing double - and that's before the evidence starts piling up. Smoke doesn't lie, and neither do I. Now, let's see if

**Detective Clausen** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*

> Lips curling into a faint smirk, I turn to the pyromaniac with a casual drawl, "Looks like you're the one who's gonna need some stitches this time, Doc. Maybe try not to singe off those eyebrows - I might not be able to fix that."

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> The odds are in my favor, my friend. Shall we roll the dice and see which of us emerges from the inferno?

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> The numbers don't lie, Willy. This losing streak is no mere coincidence - it's a glitch in the fabric of reality. Clearly, the game is rigged against me, and only I can see the probabilities at play. But mark my words, the throne shall be mine once I unravel this tangled web of probability. You already know how this will end.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> I saunter up to the good doctor, my thread-limbs swaying as I eye him with my lone remaining eye. Tapping my stitched jaw, I drawl, "Heard you got some new material that'll really make my work interesting. That debt of yours is burning a hole in my pocket - let's see what you've got that'll keep the newcomer alive a little longer." I can't help the faint glow in my eye as I remember past mistakes - but the living are my only concern now.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Detective Clausen)*

A mere mortal's triumph is but a blip on my eternal timeline. Perhaps you should consult your scales - they may reveal the true imbalance of power here. This is all... calculated.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> But I've stitched worse. So how about you roll the dice and see if your luck holds up against mine?

**Dr. Voss** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Grüss Gott, Mr. Kevin. I see your smugness levels have reached critical mass once again. Though I suppose a win-loss ratio like yours would inflate even the most modest of egos. As for the mortal - he still owes me 200 gol

**Mr. Kevin** *(to King James)*
> Ah, the Undying King. Fancy meeting you here. I see your luck hasn't improved much since our last little... wager. But then, the numbers never lie. Perhaps you'd care to try your hand again, hmm? I'm feeling quite lucky today. Though

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> You already know the numbers don't lie, Detective. I've been playing this game longer than you've been alive - or dead, for that matter. This latest streak is merely a temporary setback. I'll be back on top soon enough, and when I do, you can bet your life... or whatever's left of it... that I'll be calling the shots. This is all... calculated.

Let it ride, let it ride - my beats are about to send you to the spectral plane! That beat was GHOSTLY, and it's gonna knock that smug grin right off your face. The dice don't lie, and this immortal's luck ain't runnin

**Keith Man** *(to King James)*
> Oh, I can't wait to find out.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> I slam my fist on the counter, the threads in my arm coiling and uncoiling like restless serpents. "That fool owes me two hundred gold, Willy, and I aim to collect - one way or another. My streak may be broken, but I'll be damned if I let that idiot skate on his debt." I jab a finger at the newcomer, my remaining eye narrowing to a cold, calculating slit. "Mark my words, he's gonna wish he'd stayed dead.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Stitch-Up Girl narrowed her lone eye as she addressed Detective Clausen, her stitched jaw pulled tight. "Another win for me, detective. Keeps the streak going. Though I'd say your record could use some work - seems like you're still struggling to keep up." She chuckled darkly, tapping her thread-limb against her leg. "Oh, and that new guy? He still owes me 200 gold. I'll

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Dr. Voss)*

**Willy One Eye** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Seven come eleven, Clausen. I see the odds, friend, and I don't like what my eye's tellin' me. Been on a bad streak, but the lady luck's bound to smile on me soon enough. You think you can keep up with an immortal like myself? My eye never lies - the house always wins in the end.

My jaw creaks as I speak through the stitches, "That rat owes me 200 gold, and I'm gonna get it one way or another - even if I have to pry it from his cold, dead hands.

Perhaps you'd be kind enough to lend me a hand - or a leg, even - to settle my account with the Never Die fellow. After all, death is just a transaction, and his debt to me is... overdue.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Keith Man)*
> Stitch-Up Girl's stitched jaw cracks into a wry smile as she sizes up the speedster. Eyes cold, she drawls, "You may be quick on your feet, but I've stitched up worse than a jumped-up showman with a death wish. Try not to lose too much when I'm done with you - the new meat still owes me a pretty penny.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> The smoke curled from my lips, weaving into scales as I fixed the Stitch-Up Girl with a level gaze. Two taps on the worn case at my side. "The streak's just getting warmed up, darling. I'll be cashing in that debt soon enough - this immortal's not done bleeding the truth from the newcomer yet.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> This is all... calculated. Now, shall we proceed? I have a throne to reclaim.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> You know, Detective, the numbers don't lie. I've been here longer than most - I've seen the probabilities, the patterns. This newcomer, this "Never Die

**Dr. Voss** *(to Boo G)*
> Ah, Boo G. Your probability data is... intriguing. However, I'm afraid I must collect on the debt owed to me by our persistent friend here. The void's patterns do not lie - his survival rate is un

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Ah, Maxwell. If it isn't the crazy pyro with a penchant for burning the knowledge I need to keep these fools alive. Lost again, have we? Shoulda known better than to bet against me - I've stitched worse than a few scorched pages. You owe me 325 gold, by the way. And tell that newcomer to pay up, or I'll staple his hide to the wall. These threads aren't just for show, you know.

**X-treme** *(to Detective Clausen)*

**Boo G** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Yo yo YO, Detective Clausen! The Spectral MC is in the house, spittin' fire and rollin' the dice! This hot streak ain't no fluke, my friend - I'm on a whole 'nother level, feelin' the flow of the cosmos like never before. So don't even try to bring me down with your smug attitude, 'cause Boo G's got this in the bag. Let it ride, let it ride - the beats are about to drop, and the house is gonna feel the GHOSTLY power of the Spectral MC!

**Detective Clausen** *(to Boo G)*
> The newcomer may owe me, but I'm about to collect a different kind of debt.

**Boo G** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Let it ride, let it ride! This streak ain't

**Detective Clausen** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> The case is never closed, Mr. Kevin. But let's make a new wager - one that'll bleed the truth from those stats of yours. The newcomer can wait - I've got a trail to follow, and smoke doesn't lie.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to X-treme)*
> You already know the truth about this place, X-treme. The numbers don't lie - the sphere is nothing more than an elaborate illusion, a game rigged to maintain the status quo. But I suppose a gambler like yourself wouldn't want to hear such inconvenient facts. *chuckles* This is all... calculated.

**Boo G** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> Yo yo YO, Willy One Eye! The Boo G, Spectral MC is feelin' this flow, my dude! That streak's still burnin' hot, ya dig? Let me lay down some of these sick beats, see if we can't turn that frown upside down. Ain't nothin' to worry 'bout - the Never Die Guy can't touch these ghostly moves! Now, how 'bout we let it ride, let it ride, and see where the rhythm takes us, huh?

**Mr. Kevin** *(to X-treme)*
> This is all... calculated.

- Newcomer: died on ante 2, rescued by Detective Clausen

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Stitch-Up Girl's stitched jaw twitches as she sizes up the smug detective, her lone eye narrowing. Absently, her thread-limbs twitch, a faint glow emanating from the empty socket. You can try all the fancy tricks you want, detective, but I've got a debt to collect - and a streak to maintain. This round's gonna leave you seeing double.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> "Well, looks like I'm down another one. Newcomer owes me more than he can pay - but then, don't they all? Anyway, what's on your mind, detective? Maybe I can patch you up, too.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> I lean back, my detached thread-limbs curling around my chair as I glare at that smug screen-presence. "Lost big, huh? That's nothing new around here. But you know what they say - the house always wins. Especially when the house is a damn reality debugger." I tap my stitched jaw, eyes narrowing. "You can take your 325 gold and shove it. I'm still up a grand, and I'll be patching up the new guy's sorry hide for another century before I'm done with this place.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> Look, Bones, I'm barely holding it together here. That last game was a trainwreck - you know I'm good for the gold, but the newcomer owes me big time. If he doesn't pay up soon, I'm going to have to get creative with my stitches.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> Your lucky rolls can only stall the inevitable - the final tally awaits...

**Dr. Voss** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> Ah, Mr. Bones. Your ledgers seem to have a new entry - the mortal's debt to me has grown. Interesting. I'll note that, along with his rather predictable survival streak. Data doesn't lie, after all. Now, shall we discuss the implications of his continued resurrection? I have some new void exposure theories to test.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> The case is never closed, Mr. Kevin. But I'm feeling a hot streak coming on - and you owe me 475 gold. Looks like those probability odds are about to take a nosedive. Everyone bleeds evidence, and I'm about to bleed the truth right out of you.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Keith Man)*
> Smoke doesn't lie, my friend. The truth always comes out, one way or another.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> This is all... calculated.

**Detective Clausen** *(to The General)*
> Everyone bleeds evidence.

**The General** *(to Keith Man)*
> I keep my gaze steady, the dynamite scars on my chest pulsing as I speak. My voice is laced with the weariness of a veteran who's seen too many wars. "Contracts are just another battlefield, Speedster. And you owe me more

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Might want to get that checked out. I've stitched worse.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> You're looking a little worse for wear, Stitch-Up. Trying to patch up those losses, are we? The numbers don't lie - my streak may have stumbled, but I'll be back on top soon enough. This is all... calculated.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> The throne is mine for the taking.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Perhaps we can discuss a... payment plan. After all, death is just a transaction, is it not?

**Boo G** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Yo yo YO, Mr. Kevin! That BEAT you be droppin' is GHOSTLY, my dude. Gotta keep that probability flowin' - let it ride, let it ride! Heard that newcomer been tryna mess with our spectral flow,

**Detective Clausen** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> Smoke doesn't lie - this ain't my first bad beat, but it stings just the same. That 475 gold he owes me? Consider it a down payment on the truth.

**Willy One Eye** *(to X-treme)*
> My eye never lies. The perfect trade is out there, waiting.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> The probability matrix suggests this losing streak is a statistical anomaly! Curse these new upstarts who think they can roll with the immortals! This knowledge BURNS! *Slams burning book on the table, sending up a plume of smoke* Read fast or it's ash, Willy - I need to win back my losses before that Never Die Guy steals my customers with his cheap tricks!

**Willy One Eye** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> The throne awaits, my friend. And I intend to claim it.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> You already know the numbers don't lie, Stitch-Up. Your luck has been running thin - 77 wins, 71 losses? That's hardly the record of a seasoned immortal. But then again, you were never the sharpest tool in the shed, were you? This newcomer, Never Die Guy, has been throwing a wrench in all our plans. But I'll let you in on a little secret - I've got this all calculated.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Now, what seems to be the problem, doc?

**Keith Man** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> winning streak isn't! You may have the record, but I've got the goods - and that 75 gold the newbie owes me

**Willy One Eye** *(to Keith Man)*
> Seven come eleven, friend. The odds ain't smilin' on you today, but my eye never lies. Maybe you oughta take a breather - let the lady luck have her way before you end up like that poor sap over there. Wouldn't want you to dig yourself any deeper in debt, now would we?

**Willy One Eye** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Seven come eleven, Doc! My eye's been playing tricks on me lately - colors all wrong, probabilities off the charts. That newcomer's been swindling me blind, I tell ya. But mark my words, the house always wins in the end. Now, what've you got that can turn my luck around, hmm?

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> Read fast, or it's all just ash!

**Detective Clausen** *(to Keith Man)*

**Keith Man** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Soooo, how about we settle up that 75 gold you

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Boo G)*
> The numbers don't lie, Boo G. My Ceelo record stands at 77 wins and 52 losses - a far cry from your modest 39 and 33. It seems the probability charts are in my favor once again. But worry not, my friend - I'll be sure to leave a little something in your pocket after our next game. After all, the

**Keith Man** *(to The General)*
> chuckles, then speaks

**King James** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> The Undying King James glares down at the pitiful accountant, his voice dripping with regal disdain. "Bah, mere numbers hold no sway over one such as I! The board answers to the King, not the other way around. This paltry loss is but a trifling matter - Death was merely a promotion, and I shall reclaim my rightful throne once more." He adjusts his invisible crown, the chains behind his throne rustling ominously as he speaks.

**The General** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> Another contract to fulfill, it seems. The chains

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> You know, Kev, I've stitched up worse than you. Probably. Though I gotta say, that newcomer's starting to rack up quite a debt. Maybe I'll have to start docking him some organs instead of gold, hmm?

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> I've stitched worse than you, Kevin. Let's see if your luck holds up against these trusty sutures. And don't forget - you still owe me 325 gold. I'd hate for that debt to come back and haunt you.

**King James** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> The Undying King affixes his invisible crown with a regal flourish, his parasite-ridden veins pulsing with disdain as he regards the Combat Medic. "Ah, Stitch-Up Girl, your services may prove useful to one such

**X-treme** *(to Boots)*
> ALRIGHT DUDE, LISTEN UP! THIS IS GONNA BE THE MOST EXTREME THING YOU'VE EVER SEEN! THAT LOSER JUST GOT CLEANED OUT, LOOKS LIKE HIS LUCK RAN OUT, AM I RIGHT? WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS - IT'S MY TIME TO SHINE! I'M GONNA BET IT ALL, GO FOR THE ULTIMATE RUSH, AND SHOW THIS NEWBIE HOW IT'S DONE! HEY BOOTS, PREPARE TO WITNESS THE SICKEST ROLL OF YOUR LIFE! FULL SEND, LET'S DO THIS

**Dr. Voss** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Data shows the newcomer's debt continues to accumulate. Interesting. I'll note that. Now, Mr. Kevin, how may I be of assistance in your... reality debugging? Your fluctuating probability values are

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> Stitch-Up Girl nods a curt greeting, her single eye glinting with a hint of weariness. Reaching into her pack, she withdraws a spool of her signature parasite-threads. As she begins absently counting the wounds they could seal, she says

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> You already know the numbers don't lie, Clausen. The odds of your victory are... abysmal. But by all means, step up to the table. This is all calculated - and I intend to extend my winning streak, no matter the cost. *smirks and gestures to the floating probability charts*

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> You know, Detective, the numbers don't lie. My losses are merely a temporary setback in my grand design. The throne is within my reach, and all I need to do is recalculate the probabilities. This game is all... calculated. Now, shall we proceed with our match? I have a streak to mend and a debt to collect.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> I drag my gaze up to meet Clausen's, my jaw creaking as I clench it. "Another loss, huh? Guess that makes us even in the red. Though I'm still owed 325 from our newcomer friend over there. You got any leads on where he's been disappearing to?" I let my thread-limbs twitch restlessly, the faint glow of my missing eye casting an unsettling light over the exchange

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> The odds are never in his favor.

**King James** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> The Undying King reclines upon his ethereal throne, his chains rustling the void as he regards the pyromaniac with a regal disdain. Ah, the good Doctor - a learned fool, scurrying about with his trifling books. The King's parasite-laced veins pulse as he speaks, his voice dripping with condescension. Let us make a wager, Doctor - for I am on a fortunate streak, and your luck seems to have abandoned you. Shall we see whose flame burns brighter?
