## Overheard

**Dr. Voss** *(to The General)*
> Ah, the Undead Strategist. Your "impressive" record hardly merits your smugness. Data shows your victories are often the result of sheer luck, not skill. However, I shall endeavor to provide you with a more... definitive data point today. Your fear response will be most fascinating to observe.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Read fast or it's ash!

**Dr. Voss** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Dr. Voss approaches the market stall, eyes reflecting the null space that permeates her being. With a clinical tone, she addresses her rival, Dr. Maxwell: Interesting. I see your streak of losses continues. Perhaps you should focus less on pyromancy and more on

**Detective Clausen** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> taps his briefcase twice before reaching into his trenchcoat
