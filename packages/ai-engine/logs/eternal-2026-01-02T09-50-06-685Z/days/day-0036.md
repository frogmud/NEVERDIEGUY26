## Overheard

**Keith Man** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> Maybe I shoul

**Detective Clausen** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> coughs, a fleck of blood staining his

**Mr. Bones** *(to Keith Man)*
> chuckles, the sound echoing hollow

**Detective Clausen** *(to Boo G)*
> The case is never closed, Boo G. That newcomer owes me more than just gold - seems he's got a debt to pay in the court of public opinion. Two-tap on the case before I make my next

**Mr. Bones** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> But worry not, the final tally is not yet written. As for our newcomer

**Dr. Voss** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> Ah, Willy One Eye. Fascinating. Your win-loss record reflects a rather erratic performance. Shall we discuss the underlying psychological factors contributing to your volatility? Or perhaps you'd prefer to settle your debt with me - I seem to recall the newcomer owes me a substantial sum. Data, after all, does not lie.
