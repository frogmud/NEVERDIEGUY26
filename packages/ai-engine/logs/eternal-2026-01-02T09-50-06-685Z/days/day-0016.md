## Overheard

**King James** *(to The General)*
> The Undying King reclines in his throne, idly adjusting the invisible crown atop his head as he regards the General with a regal disdain. His voice drips with condescension, "Ah, my dear General, your luck seems to have taken a turn for the worse. Fret not, for the board answers to me, and I shall see that the scales are balanced in your favor. This newcomer is but a fleeting distraction - Death was merely a promotion for one such as I.

**Willy One Eye** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> You best watch your step, or you might find yourself owing me more than you can pay.
