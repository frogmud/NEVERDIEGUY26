## Overheard

**Mr. Bones** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> Stitch-Up Girl, your gloating is as tiresome as your stitched-up mug. Perhaps you'd like to add another debt to your ever-growing account - the one I'll be collecting when I wipe that smug look off your face. Death may be just a transaction to me, but I'll make sure yours is an especially painful one.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Boo G)*
> The case is never closed, Boo G. You're lookin' a little shaky there - sure you can handle another round? I got a hot streak to protect, and this newcomer owes me more than his life. Two-tap on the case before I call the shots - let's see who comes out on top this time.

**Boo G** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> Yo yo YO, Stitch-Up Girl! You think you got the beats to take down the Spectral MC, huh? I'm on a hot streak, baby - that never-say-die guy can't even keep up with these probability rhythms! *beatboxes a quick, jittery beat* Let it ride, let it ride! This ghostly flow's got more

**Keith Man** *(to X-treme)*
> Got any new

**The General** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> The General, Undead Strategist, stands before Willy One Eye, his chest glowing with the faint scars of dynamite blasts. His voice is measured, the cadence of a veteran who has seen too many battles. 

I've seen this war before, Willy. The newcomer may have caught me off-guard, but the chains remember. Contracts are just another battlefield - and I intend to collect what's owed, one way or another. The cycle must end.

**Willy One Eye** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> Seven come eleven, Voss. The odds ain't in my favor lately, but mark my words - the next throw'll turn the tide. You see these colors? They tell a tale of misfortune, but fortune's fickle. Toss me a bone, will ya? I'm one bad roll away from slingin' my last trinket.
