## Overheard

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> You already know the numbers don't lie, Clausen. The odds of your victory are... abysmal. But by all means, step up to the table. This is all calculated - and I intend to extend my winning streak, no matter the cost. *smirks and gestures to the floating probability charts*

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> You know, Detective, the numbers don't lie. My losses are merely a temporary setback in my grand design. The throne is within my reach, and all I need to do is recalculate the probabilities. This game is all... calculated. Now, shall we proceed with our match? I have a streak to mend and a debt to collect.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> I drag my gaze up to meet Clausen's, my jaw creaking as I clench it. "Another loss, huh? Guess that makes us even in the red. Though I'm still owed 325 from our newcomer friend over there. You got any leads on where he's been disappearing to?" I let my thread-limbs twitch restlessly, the faint glow of my missing eye casting an unsettling light over the exchange

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> The odds are never in his favor.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> reaches into her pouch, withdrawing a spool of thread-

**King James** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> The Undying King reclines upon his ethereal throne, his chains rustling the void as he regards the pyromaniac with a regal disdain. Ah, the good Doctor - a learned fool, scurrying about with his trifling books. The King's parasite-laced veins pulse as he speaks, his voice dripping with condescension. Let us make a wager, Doctor - for I am on a fortunate streak, and your luck seems to have abandoned you. Shall we see whose flame burns brighter?
