## Overheard

**Boo G** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Yo yo YO! Boo G in the house, spittin' them ghostly beats! Yo Kev, you seein' this?? That probability debugger thinks he's got the upper hand, but I'm about to throw down some sick rhymes that'll shake this whole market! Let it ride, let it ride - I'm feelin' the flow, and this newcomer ain't got nothin' on my spectral skills. That beat

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> The throne remains within my grasp

**King James** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> The Undying King scowls, his veined skull gleaming in the ethereal light of the market. With a haughty disdain, he declares, "Wretched Willy, your meager wins are but crumbs before the might of the crown. The board answers to me, not the whims of chance. This losing streak shall be rectified, for the King does not lose - death was merely a promotion.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Boo G)*
> It seems the odds are ever
