## Overheard

**Detective Clausen** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> The case is never closed, Mr. Kevin. And I'll be damned if I let some upstart mortal slip through the cracks - he owes me 125 gold, and I intend to collect. *coughs, a spatter of blood hitting the ground* Smoke doesn't lie, and neither do my instincts. This streak ends here.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Ah, the Infernal Detective, come to try your luck against Death's Accountant, have we? Your record may be impressive, but your soul's debt is ever-growing. I've a bone to pick with you - your streak may end today, and your account will be... overdue.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Don't worry, I'll patch you up. For a price, of course. You still owe me

**King James** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> The Undying King settles into his throne, chains rustling behind him as he adjusts the invisible crown upon his brow. His parasite-laced gaze falls upon the skeletal accountant, a hint of disdain in his regal tone. Ah, Death

**Willy One Eye** *(to X-treme)*
> But maybe we can even the score, eh? I've got a little something that might change your luck.
