**Mr. Bones** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> I'm afraid your luck has simply run its course, Mr. Kevin. The final tally always catches up with us, no matter how we try to manipulate the odds. Perhaps it's time to settle your debts before they come due. After all, death is just a transaction - and your account is... overdue.
