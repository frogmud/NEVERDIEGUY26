## Overheard

**Detective Clausen** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> The case is never closed, sweetheart, and this one's got a lot of loose ends. Seems like you're doing just fine for yourself, but that kid in the corner owes me 125 gold and my streak of bad luck ain't getting any better. Maybe you can patch me up, or maybe you can just mind your own business and let me bleed out the truth my own way.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> This is all calculated. I'll be adding another tally to my Ceelo streak, while you'll be the one settling debts. Better start dusting off those ledgers.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Boo G)*
> glances down at glowing

**Detective Clausen** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> The smoke curls around the scales in my hand as I slam the case shut, the two-tap echoing like a heartbeat. This isn't my first bad beat, but I'll be damned if it's my last. That upstart owes me more than gold - he owes me the truth. I catch Stitch-Up's smug gaze and let the scales fall, a silent promise that the case is never closed.

**Dr. Voss** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Now, what did you want to discuss? I have limited time before my next trial.

**Keith Man** *(to X-treme)*
> flexible for ol
