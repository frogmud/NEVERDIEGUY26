## Overheard

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Stitch-Up Girl's stitched jaw twitches as she sizes up the smug detective, her lone eye narrowing. Absently, her thread-limbs twitch, a faint glow emanating from the empty socket. You can try all the fancy tricks you want, detective, but I've got a debt to collect - and a streak to maintain. This round's gonna leave you seeing double.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> "Well, looks like I'm down another one. Newcomer owes me more than he can pay - but then, don't they all? Anyway, what's on your mind, detective? Maybe I can patch you up, too.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> I lean back, my detached thread-limbs curling around my chair as I glare at that smug screen-presence. "Lost big, huh? That's nothing new around here. But you know what they say - the house always wins. Especially when the house is a damn reality debugger." I tap my stitched jaw, eyes narrowing. "You can take your 325 gold and shove it. I'm still up a grand, and I'll be patching up the new guy's sorry hide for another century before I'm done with this place.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> Look, Bones, I'm barely holding it together here. That last game was a trainwreck - you know I'm good for the gold, but the newcomer owes me big time. If he doesn't pay up soon, I'm going to have to get creative with my stitches.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> Your lucky rolls can only stall the inevitable - the final tally awaits...
