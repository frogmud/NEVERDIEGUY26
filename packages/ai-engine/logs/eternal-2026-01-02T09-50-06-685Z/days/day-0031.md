## Overheard

**Mr. Bones** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Your luck is about to run out.

**Dr. Voss** *(to Boo G)*
> Ah, Boo G. Your confidence is... interesting. However, the data does not lie - my win-loss record speaks for itself. Perhaps you would care to test your probability against mine once more? I must remind you, the newcomer still owes me a considerable sum. I would hate for that debt to grow further.

**Dr. Voss** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> And I'm still waiting for that 125 gold you owe me. Data doesn't lie.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> This newcomer knows nothing of the infinite dance of chance - but I, Dr. Maxwell, Pyromaniac Librarian, shall enlighten him. With the proper tinder, even a dying ember can blaze anew!

**Mr. Bones** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Ah, Mr. Kevin, my dear debugger of reality. What a pleasant surprise to see you in this ever-shifting plane of existence. I must say, your streak is quite impressive, though I fear my own has been... less than stellar of
