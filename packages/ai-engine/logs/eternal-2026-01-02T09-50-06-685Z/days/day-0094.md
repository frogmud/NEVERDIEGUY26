## Overheard

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> The throne awaits, my friend. And I intend to claim it.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> You already know the numbers don't lie, Stitch-Up. Your luck has been running thin - 77 wins, 71 losses? That's hardly the record of a seasoned immortal. But then again, you were never the sharpest tool in the shed, were you? This newcomer, Never Die Guy, has been throwing a wrench in all our plans. But I'll let you in on a little secret - I've got this all calculated.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Now, what seems to be the problem, doc?

**Keith Man** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> winning streak isn't! You may have the record, but I've got the goods - and that 75 gold the newbie owes me

**Willy One Eye** *(to Keith Man)*
> Seven come eleven, friend. The odds ain't smilin' on you today, but my eye never lies. Maybe you oughta take a breather - let the lady luck have her way before you end up like that poor sap over there. Wouldn't want you to dig yourself any deeper in debt, now would we?

**Willy One Eye** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Seven come eleven, Doc! My eye's been playing tricks on me lately - colors all wrong, probabilities off the charts. That newcomer's been swindling me blind, I tell ya. But mark my words, the house always wins in the end. Now, what've you got that can turn my luck around, hmm?

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> Read fast, or it's all just ash!
