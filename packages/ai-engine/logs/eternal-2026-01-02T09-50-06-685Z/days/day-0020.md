> Interesting. I'll note that. Your smug aura is... predictable. While your rival's loss may be momentary, the data suggests your own streak of losses will soon come to an end. Perhaps you would care to test that hypothesis, Boo G? I've been collecting intriguing void exposure readings from our newcomer - I'd be most interested to see how they impact our next round.
