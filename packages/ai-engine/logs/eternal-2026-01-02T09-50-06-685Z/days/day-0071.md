## Overheard

**Boo G** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> That newcomer

**Boo G** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> Yo yo YO, Stitch-Up! The dice ain't been rollin' my way, but this Boo G's still got that GHOSTLY flow, ya dig? I lost the last two, but the rhythm's just gettin' started. That newcomer's been throwin' me off, but I'mma let this one RIDE!

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> You already know the numbers don't lie, Detective. I've been playing this game longer than you've been alive - or dead, for that matter. This latest streak is merely a temporary setback. I'll be back on top soon enough, and when I do, you can bet your life... or whatever's left of it... that I'll be calling the shots. This is all... calculated.

**Keith Man** *(to The General)*
> Now, I believe the new guy owes me a few coins, but

**Detective Clausen** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> I've got a hot streak going, and that debt of yours just keeps
