## Overheard

**Detective Clausen** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> Everyone bleeds evidence, and this one's got a paper trail as thick as the Inferno. You can't hide the truth

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> You already know the numbers don't lie, Keith. Your record speaks for itself - a flash in the pan, a mere speedster in the face of eternity. Enjoy your fleeting moment, for I have calculated the probabilities, and your luck has run its course. This is all... calculated.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> You already know the numbers don't lie, Stitch-Up Girl. My losses are merely a calculated blip - the probability charts show the tide is about to turn. That newcomer may think he's got an edge, but we both know the true immortals hold all the cards in this game. This is all... calculated.

**Mr. Bones** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> a bit overdrawn. Perhaps we should discuss your arrears over a round of Cee-lo? I simply can't resist the chance to add another tally mark to my growing collection.

**The General** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> I've seen this war before, Mr. Kevin. These contracts, these debts - they're just another battlefield. The chains remember, and I aim to break this cycle. The newcomer owes me, but perhaps we can find a more...strategic resolution. My veins pulse with dynam
