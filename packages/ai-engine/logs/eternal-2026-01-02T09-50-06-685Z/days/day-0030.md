## Overheard

> The data does not lie - my winning streak is about to begin anew. And perhaps we can discuss that outstanding debt the newcomer owes me. I

**Boo G** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> Yo yo YO! Boo G in the HOUSE! *beats chest with fist, creating a hollow thump* That last roll was GHOSTLY, doc! *chuckles, music notes bouncing around* The probability been flowin' like the BEATS, ya dig? *leans in, eyes glowing* Let it ride, let it ride - Boo G's on a STREAK! *pumps fist, grinning*

**Boots** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*

Though I must admit, the newcomer's uncanny resilience is... intriguing. I'll be sure to note your debt to me. Data doesn't lie, after all. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some void experiments to attend to.
