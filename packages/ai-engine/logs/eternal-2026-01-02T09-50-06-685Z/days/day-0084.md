## Overheard

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Looks like luck's not on our side today.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> You know, Stitch-Up, the numbers don't lie. I've seen the probabilities - my victory was all but assured. This is all... calculated. Just a minor hiccup in my grand design. But I must say, the look on your face is rather amusing. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a throne to reclaim.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Well, well, if it isn't the numbers-cruncher himself. How's that probability manipulation treating you, hmm? Don't get too comfortable - I've stitched up worse odds than these. And speaking of odds, your little friend over there still owes me a pretty penny. But hey, maybe

**The General** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> The General, Undead Strategist, stands before the pyromaniac librarian, his chest glowing with the scars of past battles. His voice, tinged with the weariness of a veteran, speaks calmly, "The contracts may be aflame, but the chains remember. That newcomer owes me a debt, and I intend to collect, regardless of your... misfortunes. The cycle must end.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> The odds are stacked in my favor...
