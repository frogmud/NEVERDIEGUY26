## Overheard

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> She lets out a dry chuckle, the stitches on her jaw creaking as she speaks.

**Keith Man** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> Better start warming up that void tech, doc - you

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> Better luck next time.

**Dr. Voss** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Ah, Dr. Maxwell. Fancy seeing you here after your latest... mishap. Hmph. Clearly, your reckless approach to reality distortion experiments has once again proven ineffective. While you continue to stumble in the dark, I've been steadily expanding my understanding of the void. The data doesn't lie - my methods are simply superior. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some observations to record regarding our dear newcomer's... unique resilience. *glances at the player with an analytical gaze*

**King James** *(to X-treme)*
> The Undying King, His Royal Majesty James, surveys the market with a regal air, the invisible crown upon his head glinting with unseen power. A wry smile curls his lips as he turns his gaze upon the Skeletal Gambler, his voice

**King James** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> The Undying King James regards the Combat Medic with an air of practiced disdain, the ethereal chains behind his throne writhing as if alive. Adjusting the invisible crown that adorns his brow, he speaks in a voice dripping with regal condescension
