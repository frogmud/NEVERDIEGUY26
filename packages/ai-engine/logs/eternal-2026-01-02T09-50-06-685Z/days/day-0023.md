## Overheard

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Careful that that briefcase doesn't get to be a habit. Don't want to end up like the others.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> Guess we'll be

**Keith Man** *(to Boo G)*
> blow this streak wide open! You better bring your A

**King James** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> The Undying King surveys the Cyclopean Merchant with a disdainful gaze, the chains of the void rustling behind his throne. His parasite-veined brow furrows as he speaks, his royal disdain clear.

This newcomer, this "Never Die Guy," shall soon learn that the true power lies with the immortal crown.

**X-treme** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> WHAT'S UP DAWG?! X-TREME, SKELETAL GAMBLER in the HOUSE! *does a backflip and lands with a rattling of bones* Yo, Voss! Still tryin' to figure out that VOID
