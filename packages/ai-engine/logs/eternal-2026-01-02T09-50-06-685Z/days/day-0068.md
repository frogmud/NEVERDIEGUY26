## Overheard

**Keith Man** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> lucky this time...

**Detective Clausen** *(to Keith Man)*
> Everyone bleeds evidence...and tonight, the truth's gonna bleed all over that Cee-lo table.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> I saunter up to the good doctor, my thread-limbs swaying as I eye him with my lone remaining eye. Tapping my stitched jaw, I drawl, "Heard you got some new material that'll really make my work interesting. That debt of yours is burning a hole in my pocket - let's see what you've got that'll keep the newcomer alive a little longer." I can't help the faint glow in my eye as I remember past mistakes - but the living are my only concern now.
