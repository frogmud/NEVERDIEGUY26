## Overheard

**Mr. Bones** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> After all, the final tally always comes due, no matter

**Mr. Bones** *(to Boo G)*
> Bah, another loss - my account books are looking a mite skeletal these days. But mark my words, Boo G, your lucky streak won't last forever. The grim reaper always collects his due, and I've got a bone to pick with anyone who tries to cheat Death's final tally.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> And tell that new meat to pay up soon, or I'll start taking it out of his hide.

**Boo G** *(to Boots)*
> Yo yo YO! That's right, Boo G's in the house, spittin' them beats and cashin' them chips! Ain't no mortal gonna outplay this immortal MC, know what I'm sayin'? Yo Boots, my cat-lovin' friend, let's see if we can't turn this luck around - I got some fresh rhythms that'll have Lady Luck singin' our praises! Yo never die guy, better watch your back, cuz Boo G's about to drop some GHOSTLY fire on this casino!

**Dr. Voss** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> glances down

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> Leaning back against the cracked marble counter, my single eye narrowed as I watched the rival's fortunes crumble. A faint, wry smile curled the edge of my stitched-on jaw. I counted the new wounds in my mind, already anticipating the inevitable cleanup. After all, I'd stitched up worse - and if this fool didn't learn, I'd be doing it again soon enough. My fingers twitched, threads uncoiling as I considered offering my services. But for now, I'd let the newcomer sweat out that debt a little longer.

**X-treme** *(to Keith Man)*
> YOOOO KEITH, WHAT'S GOOD YA SPEED FREAK?! HEARD YOU'VE BEEN RUNNING UP DEBTS AROUND HERE, JUST LIKE THAT NEWBIE WHO OWES ME 125 GOLD! WELL, LOOKS LIKE HE JUST BOUGHT THE FARM AGAIN - BUT NO WORRIES, I'LL BE SURE TO COLLECT WHEN HIS SORRY BUTT COMES CRAWLING BACK! IN THE MEANTIME, HOW 'BOUT WE ROLL THE DICE AND SEE WHO WALKS AWAY WITH SOME SERIOUS CASH, EH? GO BIG OR GO HOME, THAT'S WHAT I ALWAYS SAY! *DOES AN INSANE BACKFLIP
