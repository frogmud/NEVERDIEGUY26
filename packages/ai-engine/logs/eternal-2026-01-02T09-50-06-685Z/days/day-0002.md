**Mr. Bones** *(to Body Count)*
> Ah, yes, Body Count. Ever the silent assassin, but your account is... overdue. Pity, I have a bone to pick with you - your streak may be impressive, but the final tally is what truly matters. Death is just a transaction, my friend, and yours seems to be... lacking

**Dr. Voss** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> turns and walks away,

**X-treme** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
