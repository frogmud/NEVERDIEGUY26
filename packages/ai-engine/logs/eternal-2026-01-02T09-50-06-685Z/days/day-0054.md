## Overheard

**Detective Clausen** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> Now, what's on your mind, Stitch-Up? I've got a hot lead to chase down, and time's a-wastin'.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Boots)*
> I lean back against the rickety stall, watching the rival's downfall with a cold, clinical eye. Counting the wounds, mentally tallying the damage - this is my specialty, after all. As Boots sidles up, I mutter under my breath, "Well, looks like someone's on a losing streak. Bet they're wishing they'd paid up that debt to Never Die Guy by now." My remaining eye gleams with a hint of dark amusement, the stitches on my jaw straining as I speak.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> I can fix that. Probably. Just don't go getting yourself killed again - you still
