## Overheard

**Boo G** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Yo yo YO, Detective Clausen! The Spectral MC is in the house, spittin' fire and rollin' the dice! This hot streak ain't no fluke, my friend - I'm on a whole 'nother level, feelin' the flow of the cosmos like never before. So don't even try to bring me down with your smug attitude, 'cause Boo G's got this in the bag. Let it ride, let it ride - the beats are about to drop, and the house is gonna feel the GHOSTLY power of the Spectral MC!

**Detective Clausen** *(to Boo G)*
> The newcomer may owe me, but I'm about to collect a different kind of debt.

**Boo G** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Let it ride, let it ride! This streak ain't

**Detective Clausen** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> The case is never closed, Mr. Kevin. But let's make a new wager - one that'll bleed the truth from those stats of yours. The newcomer can wait - I've got a trail to follow, and smoke doesn't lie.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to X-treme)*
> You already know the truth about this place, X-treme. The numbers don't lie - the sphere is nothing more than an elaborate illusion, a game rigged to maintain the status quo. But I suppose a gambler like yourself wouldn't want to hear such inconvenient facts. *chuckles* This is all... calculated.

**Boo G** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> Yo yo YO, Willy One Eye! The Boo G, Spectral MC is feelin' this flow, my dude! That streak's still burnin' hot, ya dig? Let me lay down some of these sick beats, see if we can't turn that frown upside down. Ain't nothin' to worry 'bout - the Never Die Guy can't touch these ghostly moves! Now, how 'bout we let it ride, let it ride, and see where the rhythm takes us, huh?

**Mr. Kevin** *(to X-treme)*
> This is all... calculated.
