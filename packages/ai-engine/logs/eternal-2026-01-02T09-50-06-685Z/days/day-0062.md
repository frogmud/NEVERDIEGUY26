## Overheard

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> I've stitched worse than you, Reality Debugger. So don't think you can pull one over on me. You may have a hot streak, but I've got a debt to collect from our newcomer friend. I'll be seeing you around the market, if you've got the guts.

**Detective Clausen** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> This newcomer owes

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Ah, Detective Clausen - always a pleasure. I see your record remains lackluster as ever. But no matter, the numbers always favor me. This winning streak is merely a drop in the ocean of my eternal dominance. You already know how this will end - the dice have been cast, the probabilities calculated. This is all... calculated. *A probability chart flashes beside me as I speak, the percentages shifting rapidly.*

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Boo G)*
> The numbers seem to indicate we're both on
