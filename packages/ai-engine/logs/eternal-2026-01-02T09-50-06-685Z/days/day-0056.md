## Overheard

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Let's see if your probability manipulation can

**Detective Clausen** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> The case is never closed, Mr. Bones. You can keep your smug grin - I'll be the one collecting debts, even if it means bleeding out the truth one shortcut at a time. That newcomer owes me, and I plan to cash in, whether the odds are in my favor or not.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> You think those scales of yours can weigh up against the cold, hard numbers, Clausen? The odds are stacked in my favor - this streak of mine is just getting started. *glances down at lucky D4* You can try to stack the deck, but in the end, the numbers don't lie. This game is mine to win.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> traces stitches along jawline, lips curling

**Mr. Kevin** *(to King James)*

**Keith Man** *(to Boots)*
> Time to shake things up!
