## Overheard

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> The numbers don't lie, Detective. Your winning streak may seem impressive, but I've weathered far greater storms in my endless existence. A mere mortal's triumph is but a blip on my eternal timeline. Perhaps you should consult your scales - they may reveal the true imbalance of power here. This is all... calculated.

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> But I've stitched worse. So how about you roll the dice and see if your luck holds up against mine?

**Dr. Voss** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Grüss Gott, Mr. Kevin. I see your smugness levels have reached critical mass once again. Though I suppose a win-loss ratio like yours would inflate even the most modest of egos. As for the mortal - he still owes me 200 gol

**Mr. Kevin** *(to King James)*
> Ah, the Undying King. Fancy meeting you here. I see your luck hasn't improved much since our last little... wager. But then, the numbers never lie. Perhaps you'd care to try your hand again, hmm? I'm feeling quite lucky today. Though
