## Overheard

**Mr. Bones** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Time to settle up, my frien

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> The streak continues.

**Boo G** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> Yo yo YO, Stitch-Up! That was a GHOSTLY roll, but you ain't

**Willy One Eye** *(to The General)*
> I lost another hand, General - luck's a fickle mistress. The colors ain't lining up, and my dice keep coming up snakeyes. But I'll keep throwing, even if it means going deeper in the hole. The newcomer's been a thorn in my side, and I aim to win back what's mine, one roll at a time. My eye never lies, and the odds are with me - just you wait and see.

## Vibes
- Willy One Eye: tilted (-4)
