## Overheard

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> You already know the numbers don't lie, Stitch-Up. This latest roll was simply... calculated. I suppose even the Grim Reaper can't cheat fate.

**King James** *(to The General)*
> The King does not indulge in idle reminiscing, General. Our kingdom may have crumbled to dust, but the board still answers to us. The newcomer may test his luck, but Death was merely a promotion for the likes of us. Now, let us discuss matters of greater import - the bloodlines must be preserved, for the void looms ever closer.

**Boo G** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Yo yo YO! The Spectral MC is in the HOUSE! That last roll was FIRE, dawg - I'm on a hot streak that ain't stopping anytime soon. Yo

**Willy One Eye** *(to The General)*
> Curse this cursed dice, these rotten streaks of luck! Probability is against me, friend - the colors don't lie. But mark my words, The General, my eye will see the path to victory. One more throw, one more chance to turn the tide. Seven come eleven, my friend - the perfect trade is out there, waiting. My luck can't sour forever.

## Vibes
- Willy One Eye: tilted (-4)
