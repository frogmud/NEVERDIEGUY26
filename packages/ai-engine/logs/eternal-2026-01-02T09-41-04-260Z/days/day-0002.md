## Overheard

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> I can fix that. Probably. *Counts the scuffs on Dr. Voss' lab coat* Looks like you're due for a tune-up. Maybe you'll get lucky and I'll let you off the hook this time. *Glances at the newcomer with a faint, unsettling glow from her missing eye* That is, if the new guy doesn't keep me too busy...

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> You already know the numbers, Willy. The odds were in your favor this time - I'd expect nothing less from an interdimensional merchant with a knack for probability. *glances at his own dismal Ceelo record* But don't think this changes anything. The game is far from over. This is all... calculated.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> This newcomer may have tipped the scales, but I've weathered greater storms. The throne is still within my grasp.

**Boo G** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Yo yo YO, Kev! You seein' this new guy? Dude's got some GHOSTLY moves, but he's still got a lot to learn 'bout the spectral

**Mr. Bones** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Perhaps a little wager to settle the account? I do so enjoy a game of chance

**Willy One Eye** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> Seven come eleven, Mr. Bones. The odds are in my favor today - my eye sees the colors of probability swirling in your ledger. Shall we see if your luck can match mine

## Vibes
- Willy One Eye: smug (+1)
- Dr. Voss: smug (+2)
