## Daily Diary

### Day 1
- Detective Clausen took 61 gold from Dr. Voss
- Newcomer: completed all 3 antes

**Dr. Voss** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> Now, if you'll excuse me, I have more pressing experiments to attend to.

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> mutters calculations under breath an

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Detective Clausen)*
> The probability matrix suggests our meeting is serendipitous, Detective Clausen! *cackles as a book in my hand smolders* This forbidden knowledge BURNS to be shared - but only with those bold enough to read it before it becomes ash! *mutters calculations under

**Keith Man** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Gotta-go-gotta-go-gotta--! Time is... *twitch* ...flexible, Doc. You got any books on temporal mechanics that won't


### Day 2
- Dr. Voss took 96 gold from Stitch-Up Girl
- Willy One Eye took 50 gold from Mr. Kevin

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> I can fix that. Probably. *Counts the scuffs on Dr. Voss' lab coat* Looks like you're due for a tune-up. Maybe you'll get lucky and I'll let you off the hook this time. *Glances at the newcomer with a faint, unsettling glow from her missing eye* That is, if the new guy doesn't keep me too busy...

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> You already know the numbers, Willy. The odds were in your favor this time - I'd expect nothing less from an interdimensional merchant with a knack for probability. *glances at his own dismal Ceelo record* But don't think this changes anything. The game is far from over. This is all... calculated.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> This newcomer may have tipped the scales, but I've weathered greater storms. The throne is still within my grasp.

**Boo G** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Yo yo YO, Kev! You seein' this new guy? Dude's got some GHOSTLY moves, but he's still got a lot to learn 'bout the spectral

**Mr. Bones** *(to Mr. Kevin)*
> Perhaps a little wager to settle the account? I do so enjoy a game of chance

**Willy One Eye** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> Seven come eleven, Mr. Bones. The odds are in my favor today - my eye sees the colors of probability swirling in your ledger. Shall we see if your luck can match mine


### Day 3
- Dr. Voss took 91 gold from Detective Clausen
- Dr. Maxwell took 73 gold from Detective Clausen

**Detective Clausen** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> Smoke doesn't lie, and it

**Detective Clausen** *(to Dr. Maxwell)*
> Even the dead.

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> You already know the numbers, Voss. The odds of your success here are... less than favorable. But then, when has that ever stopped you from tempting

**Dr. Voss** *(to Boots)*
> Shall we discuss the patterns I've observed? I have much to share regarding the entropic nature of reality.
