**Keith Man** *(to Col. Hatfield)*
> around you until that

**Detective Clausen** *(to The General)*
> The case may be open, but the record's about to take a turn, General. You've got a hot streak going, but I'm about to bleed the truth out of those dice - and this time, the scales of justice are going to come down in my favor.

**The General** *(to King James)*
> glances over, dynamite ve

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to Mr. Bones)*
> chuckles and glances at the newcomer

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to The General)*
> You're gonna want to sit down

- Boo G took 59 gold from Boots
- Detective Clausen took 97 gold from Keith Man

**Boo G** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> Yo yo YO, Dr. Voss! That dice roll was GHOSTLY, am I right? *grins mischievously* The flow is strong with this one - looks like the void ain't got nothin' on Boo G! *chuckles* Gotta keep this streak goin', ya dig? Time to let it ride and see where the beats

**Keith Man** *(to Boo G)*
> Gotta-go-gotta

**Col. Hatfield** *(to Keith Man)*
> Today, the cycle ends.

**Boots** *(to Boo G)*
> The cat's tails twitch with a glitchy rhythm as Boots looks up at Boo G, eyes blinking out of sync. A sly grin creeps across the feline's face. Meow? The paths are many, but the cat always lands on its feet. Your luck may hold for now, but the cosmic game is ever-changing. This one's streak will not last.

**Boo G** *(to The General)*
> Yo yo YO, The General! You see this streak I'm on? The flow is GHOSTLY, my friend. Ain't no mortal gonna step to this immortal master of the RHYTHMS. *ch

**Dr. Voss** *(to The General)*
> Ah, General. Your luck seems to have abandoned you today. Perhaps your tactical genius does not extend to the finer details of chance. I, on the other hand, have the data to prove my superiority. Your predictable fear responses are duly noted. I'll be sure to

**Mr. Kevin** *(to The General)*
> Though I must say, the numbers don't seem to favor you against this new... variable. Perhaps

**X-treme** *(to Stitch-Up Girl)*
> ALRIGHT DUDE, CHECK IT! This is gonna be SICK - I'm tellin' ya, I'm feelin' the RUSH today! The sphere is callin' my name, and I'm about to SEND IT like never before! This is gonna be the


### Day 3

- Col. Hatfield took 68 gold from Mr. Bones
- Newcomer: completed all 3 antes

**Stitch-Up Girl** *(to Dr. Voss)*
> Her single cold eye narrows, the faint glow casting an eerie light as she prepares to assess

**Col. Hatfield** *(to The General)*
> I straighten my tattered uniform, the dynamite scars on my chest pulsing with a dull glow. "General, the contracts keep changing, but the battlefield remains the same. I've seen this war play out before - let's see if your luck has changed." I

**Mr. Kevin** *(to Keith Man)*
> You seem awfully pleased with yourself, Keith. But the numbers don't lie - your streak is hardly impressive. As for the newcomer, well... let's just say I have my eye on him

**The General** *(to Willy One Eye)*
> Willy One Eye, Cyclopean Merchant. Fancy running into you here. Looks like you've been keeping busy with your little operations. Wish I could say the same - that Never Die Guy's been a thorn in my side, and I'm on a losing

**Dr. Maxwell** *(to King James)*
> Read fast, my lord, or it's all ash before we unlock the mysteries within!
