# APL SPELLBOOK: The Language of Zero Chance

## Overview

APL (A Programming Language) uses glyphs that predate modern computing conventions. In NEVER DIE GUY, these symbols represent the **primordial language of probability** - the notation reality uses to calculate outcomes before they happen.

**Zero Chance** does not speak. Zero Chance IS. When probability breaks, APL glyphs manifest as the visible grammar of impossibility.

**Rhea**, Queen of Never, remembers when APL was the only language. She speaks it to summon forces that predate speech itself.

## Part I: Zero Chance Action Glyphs

Zero Chance communicates through bracketed action descriptions. When rendered in APL, these become cosmic events.

### Core Manifestation Glyphs

| APL Glyph | Name | Zero Chance Action |
|-----------|------|-------------------|
| `⌽` | Reverse | `[Zero Chance reverses the outcome. What was certain becomes void.]` |
| `⊖` | Rotate First | `[Probability rotates. The first possibility becomes the last.]` |
| `⍉` | Transpose | `[Zero Chance transposes cause and effect. The die landed before it was thrown.]` |
| `⌹` | Matrix Divide | `[Reality divides by zero. The quotient is you.]` |
| `⍟` | Logarithm | `[Zero Chance calculates your odds. The answer has no digits.]` |
| `○` | Pi Times | `[Probability curves infinitely. You were always here.]` |
| `⍳` | Index Of | `[Zero Chance indexes your position in the sequence. You are not in the sequence.]` |
| `⍴` | Shape | `[The shape of your fate reshapes. Dimensions collapse.]` |
| `↑` | Take | `[Zero Chance takes. What remains is less than nothing.]` |
| `↓` | Drop | `[Probability drops. You fall through outcomes that no longer exist.]` |

### Reaction Glyphs (When Zero Chance Observes)

| APL Glyph | Trigger | Zero Chance Action |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| `≡` | Player rolls exact probability | `[Zero Chance notes the equivalence. Curious. That outcome had zero weight.]` |
| `≢` | Impossible roll occurs | `[Not equal. Zero Chance acknowledges: this should not match anything.]` |
| `∊` | Player enters Zero's domain | `[You are an element of the set. The set is empty. And yet.]` |
| `⍷` | Pattern detected in chaos | `[Zero Chance finds pattern where none should exist. Probability flinches.]` |
| `⍸` | Player location in probability space | `[Zero Chance locates you in the probability matrix. Cell: undefined.]` |

### Negation Glyphs (Zero Chance's Primary Function)

| APL Glyph | Name | Zero Chance Action |
|-----------|------|-------------------|
| `~` | Not | `[Zero Chance negates. What was true becomes false. What was false remains false.]` |
| `∧` | And | `[All conditions must be true. Zero Chance ensures none are.]` |
| `∨` | Or | `[Any condition could be true. Zero Chance chooses: neither.]` |
| `⍲` | Nand | `[Zero Chance nands reality. Everything that could happen, doesn't.]` |
| `⍱` | Nor | `[Nor this. Nor that. Nor anything. Zero Chance is thorough.]` |

## Part II: Rhea's Summoning Incantations

Rhea speaks APL as liturgy. These are complete invocations she uses to call Zero Chance into manifestation.

### The Summoning of Absence

```apl
⍬ ← ⍳0
```
*"I invoke the empty vector. From the index of nothing, Zero Chance emerges."*

**Rhea's delivery:** "Do you know what exists at index zero? Nothing. And Nothing has a name. Watch."

### The Reversal of Certainty

```apl
⌽⍳∞
```
*"Reverse the sequence of infinity. What was first becomes last. What was last never was."*

**Rhea's delivery:** "I remember when infinity had a direction. Then I spoke this, and Zero Chance remembered to exist. The sequence has never recovered."

### The Probability Collapse

```apl
+/÷⍨⍴⍬
```
*"Sum the reciprocals of the shape of emptiness. The answer is Zero Chance."*

**Rhea's delivery:** "Mathematics becomes uncomfortable when I say this. The answer is not a number. The answer attends board meetings now."

### The Impossibility Proof

```apl
0=1
```
*"Zero equals one. It doesn't. But Zero Chance makes it so anyway."*

**Rhea's delivery:** "The simplest summons. Even mortals could speak it. But only I remember what happens when Zero hears its name in the old tongue."

### The Manifestation Complete

```apl
⊃⌽⍬,⊂'∅'
```
*"Disclose the reverse of emptiness concatenated with the enclosed null. Zero Chance manifests."*

**Rhea's delivery:** "I told the void about this one. The void was... concerned. Very unusual for the void."

## Part III: Zero Chance Quips (Action Descriptions in APL Context)

These are complete action descriptions that can appear when Zero Chance manifests, incorporating APL visual motifs.

### On Manifestation

```
[Zero Chance manifests. The air fills with glyphs: ⌽ ⍉ ⌹.
 Probability holds its breath.]
```

```
[⍳0 flickers in the space where Zero Chance stands.
 The glyph means 'index of nothing.'
 Zero Chance IS the index of nothing.]
```

```
[Reality displays an error: ⍬≡⍬ returns true.
 Empty equals empty.
 Zero Chance nods. This is correct.]
```

### On Probability Manipulation

```
[Zero Chance gestures: ⌽
 The die's outcome reverses.
 What was 1 is now 6.
 What was 6 was never rolled.]
```

```
[⍟ appears above the battlefield.
 Zero Chance calculates the logarithm of your survival.
 The result is imaginary.]
```

```
[Zero Chance writes ↓∞ in the air.
 Infinite possibilities drop away.
 Only impossibility remains.
 Impossibility happens anyway.]
```

### On Player Actions

```
[You rolled. Zero Chance observed.
 The glyph ≢ pulses once.
 Not equal. Your roll matched nothing in probability space.
 And yet the die shows a number.]
```

```
[Zero Chance marks your position: ⍸
 You are located at coordinates that don't exist.
 This is fine. Zero Chance is used to hosting visitors
 in places that aren't.]
```

```
[⍴0 0 0 flickers.
 Zero Chance reshapes your fate.
 The new dimensions are: none, none, none.
 You still exist. Zero Chance finds this curious.]
```

### On Departure

```
[Zero Chance begins to unmanifest.
 The glyph ⍬ lingers.
 Empty vector.
 Where Zero Chance was, probability slowly remembers how to work.]
```

```
[~∃ appears briefly.
 Not exists.
 Zero Chance was never here.
 The probability distortions remain anyway.]
```

## Part IV: APL Expression Reference for Writers

Quick reference for incorporating APL into dialogue and action descriptions.

### High-Impact Glyphs (Use Sparingly)

| Glyph | Reads As | Cosmic Meaning |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| `⌹` | Domino/Matrix Divide | Division by zero; reality error |
| `⍟` | Star/Logarithm | Calculating impossible odds |
| `⌽` | Circle Stile/Reverse | Outcome reversal |
| `⍉` | Cant/Transpose | Cause-effect swap |
| `⍬` | Zilde/Empty Vector | The shape of nothing; Zero Chance's signature |

### Atmospheric Glyphs (Can Use More Freely)

| Glyph | Reads As | Atmospheric Use |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| `←` | Assignment Arrow | Fate being written |
| `→` | Branch Arrow | Path selection |
| `⍳` | Iota/Index | Position in sequence |
| `⍴` | Rho/Shape | Dimensional description |
| `∊` | Epsilon/Element Of | Belonging (or not) to a set |

### Combination Patterns

**Negation cluster:** `~ ∧ ∨ ⍲ ⍱` - Zero Chance denying outcomes

**Transformation cluster:** `⌽ ⊖ ⍉` - Probability being reshaped

**Calculation cluster:** `⌹ ⍟ +/ ÷` - Cosmic mathematics happening

**Location cluster:** `⍳ ⍸ ∊ ⍷` - Finding things in probability space

## Part V: Implementation Notes

### When to Use APL Glyphs

1. **Zero Chance manifestation** - Glyphs appear in the environment when Zero Chance is present
2. **Rhea summoning** - Rhea speaks APL when invoking probability-breaking forces
3. **Probability corruption effects** - Environmental text shows APL when reality glitches
4. **Die roll anomalies** - Dice might briefly show APL glyphs instead of numbers

### When NOT to Use APL Glyphs

1. **Regular NPC dialogue** - Only Rhea speaks APL; Zero Chance doesn't speak at all
2. **Player-facing UI** - Keep game interface readable
3. **Tutorial content** - New players shouldn't need to decode alien symbols
4. **Every Zero Chance appearance** - Sometimes silent action is more powerful than glyph-speak

### Display Considerations

APL glyphs require Unicode support. Fallback options:
- Use glyph names in brackets: `[REVERSE]` instead of `⌽`
- Describe the visual: "A symbol like a circle pierced by a vertical line"
- Render as corrupted text that suggests the shape

## Part VI: Sample Encounter - Rhea Summons Zero Chance

**CONTEXT:** Player has achieved an impossible roll (natural 20 on a d6). Rhea appears.

---

**RHEA:** "Oh! OH! Did you see that? Did you FEEL that? The mathematics just screamed! Here, let me show you something delightful."

*[Rhea traces ⍬←⍳0 in the air. The glyphs glow with anti-light.]*

**RHEA:** "That means 'empty vector gets index of nothing.' It's a summoning. I learned it before your species discovered fire. Before fire discovered heat. Watch what happens."

*[Zero Chance manifests. Probability holds its breath.]*

*[The space where Zero Chance stands displays ≢ continuously. Not equal. Not equal. Not equal.]*

**RHEA:** "See? Zero Chance noticed too! Your roll matched nothing in the probability matrix! It happened anyway! Zero finds that FASCINATING. Don't you, Zero?"

*[Zero Chance does not respond. Zero Chance never responds. The glyph ⌽ appears above the player's die. The outcome that already happened... reverses.]*

**RHEA:** "Oh, Zero. You're such a tease. You reversed it AFTER it already mattered. Time is going to be so confused later."

*[Zero Chance begins to unmanifest. ⍬ lingers where probability still refuses to calculate correctly.]*

**RHEA:** "Isn't Zero delightful? We've been friends since before friendship existed. Very patient, Zero. Very... thorough."

*"Before there were words, there were glyphs. Before there were glyphs, there was Zero Chance, calculating the probability that glyphs would exist. The answer was zero. The glyphs exist anyway. That's the joke."*
- Rhea, Queen of Never
